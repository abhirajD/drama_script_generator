    "# MOVIE SCRIPT GENERATOR\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, I give a seq2seq LSTM network word embeddings of starwars movie scripts. I have explored multiple scripts from movies dbs, TV series (even tried generating dataset for my favourite series: [Elementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_(TV_series)) etc. but we need data over which we can abstract well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abitity to abstract over data is usually determined by three factors:\n",
    "1. The Network itself\n",
    "2. The amount and quality of data\n",
    "3. Regularizations applied\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 2nd point we mentioned, [Star Wars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/star-wars-movie-scripts) is the best I found for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will be experimenting with 1 and 3 to make the script generated by the network make sense. Also, possibly have different generations of similar network. It will be interesting to observe the concepts the network abstracts and abstracts over. Given the same network, there will be stochasticity in same networks due to curriculum of teaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A tiny note on Curriculum managment\n",
    "Curriculum managment is one of my favourite topics to talk about. Curriculum is usually ignored in Data Science related industrial application, but the scientific community knows very well it makes all the difference. Suppose you are designing a network to solve 'Calculus', an obvious way to go about doing it is to show the network basic calculus problems before showing it difficult problems. If the network has no knowledge of basic calculus it wont have any concepts to work with difficult problems and will fail terribly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of above paragraph is that its extremely difficult to conduct this kind of curriculum managment with texts. Networks generating scripts which make no sense to humans is an indication of the same. Only solution to this problem is ton of data(way more than normally required).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, its a note to myself to improve over this model as and when I complete my research on Curriculum managment or Knowledge Distillation.\n"
