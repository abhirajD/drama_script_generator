1
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:12,875
It's cleanliness
everywhere I look.

2
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:14,493
It's very
disorientating.

3
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,947
Don't worry, I did not
touch your wall of crazy.

4
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,915
The idea that Irene was murdered

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,751
by a shadowy kingpin that no
one's ever seen or heard of

6
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:24,086
sounded crazy
to me, too.

7
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,589
But there may be
a pattern here.

8
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,542
A trail of bread crumbs that
leads to a great criminal mind.

9
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:32,294
And how is
Napoleon Bonaparte involved?

10
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:35,264
By my fifth night without
sleep, I may have been reaching.

11
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,132
What time is it?

12
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:38,634
Uh, it's 9:30.

13
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,102
Wednesday.

14
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:42,638
You slept for
two days straight.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,590
That's why I'm so hungry.

16
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:46,925
I'm supposed to go out
for a little while,

17
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,278
but if you're still
feeling obsessed, I can stay.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,946
No, I'm fine.

19
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:52,648
I've been
neglecting my hobby.

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,284
I'm going to visit
Swirl-Theory.com

21
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:57,620
and discuss
conspiracy theories.

22
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:59,271
Your hobby is
conspiracy theories?

23
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:00,539
No, of course not.

24
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,957
They're pure sophistry.

25
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,109
Large groups of people
cannot keep secrets.

26
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,545
My hobby is
conspiracy <i>theorists.</i>

27
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,630
I adore them.

28
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,049
As one would
a barmy uncle.

29
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:11,884
Or a pet that can't stop
walking into walls.

30
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:14,386
Have you ever heard anyone say
the CIA invented crack cocaine?

31
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:15,638
I have.

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,805
I started that.

33
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:17,890
That's ridiculous.

34
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:19,291
Mm.

35
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,727
Today, I plan to get
in touch with Zapruder--

36
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,646
that's the moderator's
nom de plume--

37
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:26,482
and share with him the results
of a secret government study,

38
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:28,300
which concludes that
rising ocean waters

39
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:32,137
will soon make a new coastline
in the Appalachian foothills.

40
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:34,490
Plans are afoot to move
the nation's capital to Omaha,

41
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:36,158
and a cadre of
elite billionaires

42
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,327
is buying up soon-to-be
beachfront property.

43
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,413
Okay, well, good
luck with that.

44
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:44,500
Mm. Enjoy your errands.

45
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,753
<i>Sherlock has made progress,</i>

46
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,672
but he's fragile.

47
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:53,092
Sebastian Moran upset
the balance that we found.

48
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:56,462
He's finally ready to deal
with his feelings about Irene.

49
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:58,614
He's only loved one person
in his life,

50
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,833
as far as I can tell,
and she was murdered.

51
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:03,335
Your contract to work as
Sherlock's sober companion

52
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:04,836
expired a week ago.

53
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:06,872
And if Sherlock
finds out,

54
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:09,091
it could destroy the
trust you've built.

55
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:12,695
Have you considered
that you yourself

56
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:15,064
could be the catalyst
for a relapse?

57
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,682
It's not forever.

58
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:20,035
It may not be forever,
but it does sound indefinite.

59
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:22,521
In the meantime,
you're not being paid.

60
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:23,689
I'm not living
paycheck to paycheck.

61
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,040
Nor are you obligated

62
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,910
to spend your savings
on behalf of someone

63
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:29,712
who's no longer your client.

64
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:33,799
I should really check to see
if everything's okay.

65
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:42,675
This thing with-with Sherlock,

66
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:45,210
there are steps.

67
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,563
Captain Gregson
suspended him from the NYPD.

68
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,881
That relationship
stabilizes him.

69
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:54,319
I just need to reopen that line
of communication between them.

70
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,077
Watson.

71
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:03,759
You want to tell me
whose house this is?

72
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,664
Zapruder.

73
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:07,032
Oh. Is that the guy you were
talking about this morning?

74
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:08,233
The conspiracy theorist.

75
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,068
His real name is
Len Pontecorvo.

76
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,754
He didn't rise to
my bait earlier.

77
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,355
Most unlike the man.

78
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:15,090
I e-mailed several of his
colleagues in Swirl Theory.

79
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,242
Turns out, no one has heard
from him since Sunday.

80
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,094
Oh, so you decided to
break into his house?

81
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:20,763
Well, his compatriots
feared the worst:

82
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,431
black-bagged
by the KGB,

83
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:24,249
taken to a secret
NASA prison.

84
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,884
Please don't tell
me you agree.

85
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,436
Of course not.
NASA doesn't maintain prisons.

86
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:29,188
Everyone knows that.

87
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,975
But I did think he may have had
a heart attack or an accident.

88
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:36,061
Which is why I let myself in
when he didn't answer his door.

89
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:38,597
This thing we're doing right
now, it's called trespassing.

90
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,815
Well, if you're worried
about Mr. Pontecorvo

91
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,700
pressing charges,
you shouldn't be.

92
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:44,953
He's got much larger
problems than us.

The department's
taking a break from you.

97
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,671
And you, couldn't take him
to the movies or something?

98
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,521
I tried.

99
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,322
Would you have preferred we left
Mr. Pontecorvo to rot?

100
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,658
I would've preferred
you laid low for a while,

101
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,395
instead of digging up some
autoerotic strangulation case.

102
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,030
Auto? You think he
did this to himself?

103
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:29,898
You think he didn't?
Well, it's hard to tell

104
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,233
without removing
the belt to examine

105
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:32,701
the ligature marks
on his neck.

106
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,570
But did notice
the belt itself is a 38.

107
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,338
Rather large for a man
of such narrow proportions,

108
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
don't you think?
Could've lost weight.

109
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:41,243
Or he could've been strangled
by a much larger man

110
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,546
and then hung on the machine
like a Christmas ornament.

111
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:45,681
Also, notice the index finger
on his right hand.

112
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:48,767
It appears to be fractured,
just above the finger nail.

113
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:50,853
Hard to auto-eroticize anything
with a broken bone

114
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,521
in your business hand, no?

115
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,473
I'll tell the M.E.
to take a close look

116
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:55,724
at the victim's neck and finger.

117
00:04:55,726 --> 00:04:57,259
Not necessary.
I already texted him.

118
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:58,944
You text him?

119
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:00,863
Seems like you think you're
a consultant on this case.

120
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:01,930
You're not.

121
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:03,482
Which is why I'm leaving.

122
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:05,734
Right after Watson and I
examine the rest of the house.

123
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:07,653
Let you know
if we learn anything.

124
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,289
Been through the man's things.

125
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,074
So far, none of
the conventional ways

126
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,043
of getting oneself killed apply.

127
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,777
Pontecorvo didn't owe
anyone money,

128
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,830
he wasn't sleeping with
anyone's wife,

129
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:18,964
wasn't sleeping with anyone.

130
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,332
Uh, don't you
think the police

131
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,884
are going to be interested
in looking at that?

132
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,719
The police are interested in
finding the killer,

133
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:26,172
which means they want any and
all evidence in my possession.

134
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,673
Whether they admit it or not.

135
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,642
Well, if all Pontecorvo did
was fill these binders,

136
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,126
maybe we should
look through them, too.

137
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,394
Hmm.

138
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,129
This one says that
North Korea is actually

139
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:37,233
the world's largest manufacturer
of high school textbooks.

140
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:39,818
The Supreme Court has been
infiltrated by Scientologists.

141
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,987
It's one of mine.

142
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:43,572
Yes, we may as well
bring them with us.

143
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:44,990
Worth a laugh, anyway.

144
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,859
Although, I promise you,
there is a conventional

145
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:49,111
explanation for Len
Pontecorvo's murder.

146
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:50,412
Information wants
to get out, Watson.

147
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:51,813
Which is why...

148
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:53,365
There is no such thing
as conspiracies.

149
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,533
We've covered this.

150
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:57,253
Hello, Clyde.

151
00:05:57,255 --> 00:06:00,155
Oh, are you
taking Clyde?

152
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:01,924
He will starve if we
leave him here.

153
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,459
Oh, I didn't know
you liked tortoises.

154
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,927
I love them.

155
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,496
They make an absolutely
delicious soup stock.

156
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:25,731
What is that?

157
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,867
It appears to be
a listening device.

158
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:32,755
Someone was bugging
the conspiracy nut.

159
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,542
You brought that
all the way over here

160
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:38,744
just to smash
it to pieces?

161
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,862
I turned it off.
I can't have it in the house.

162
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:42,798
Don't know who's on
the other end of that thing.

163
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,117
I've confirmed from
three different sources,

164
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,502
this particular
surveillance device

165
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:47,886
is not commercially
available.

166
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:50,923
You cannot buy it
if you are a civilian.

167
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,224
So, what are you saying,

168
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:54,543
the government was
bugging Len Pontecorvo?

169
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:56,512
I thought there was
no such thing as conspiracies?

170
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:59,481
Consistency is the hobgoblin
of little minds, Watson.

171
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:01,066
The fact of
the matter is,

172
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:03,218
there was a bug in
Len Pontecorvo's home.

173
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,687
One of my contacts
in London

174
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,822
just helped me find
spyware on his laptop.

175
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:09,158
Someone was monitoring
his every move.

176
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,192
Why?

177
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:11,560
Was he on to something?

178
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,729
Len Pontecorvo, rest his soul,

179
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,231
was one of the laziest thinkers
I've ever come across.

180
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,084
His ideas are insane.

181
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:20,836
Most of them, that is.

182
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:23,589
There's one that isn't
immediately laughable.

183
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:26,208
I hadn't read about it
until a short while ago.

184
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,010
"The Red Team."

185
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:29,128
Yes.

186
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,764
The title refers
to war games.

187
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,249
Every year,

188
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:37,936
the Army War College
stages a series of them.

189
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:40,939
Players consist of
military personnel

190
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:43,425
and civilian experts.

191
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:45,778
Those representing
the United States and its allies

192
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,646
comprise the Blue Team.

193
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:48,831
The Red Team are the bad guys.

194
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,733
Hmm. The players
change every year,

195
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,368
as do the scenarios
being tested.

196
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,769
But every year,

197
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:55,621
the results are published
in trade journals.

198
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,573
Except for 2009.

199
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,124
Those were
immediately classified.

200
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:01,109
Why?
Nobody knows.

201
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,129
That year's game was designed
to test the military response

202
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:06,665
to the activation of
a sleeper cell in New York City.

203
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:09,301
The Red Team's goal was to cause
maximum destruction

204
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:11,136
and chaos
with minimum resources.

205
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:12,921
Now, Len Pontecorvo believes

206
00:08:12,923 --> 00:08:15,174
they uncovered a flaw
in national security.

207
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:17,176
Something so startling,
it was immediately declared

208
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:18,594
a federal secret.

209
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:20,262
That sounds scary.

210
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:23,065
It also doesn't sound as crazy
as the other theories.

211
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,600
Yeah.

212
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,652
The identities of
the Red Teamers are classified.

213
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:29,154
But Pontecorvo uncovered
one of them.

214
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,572
A counterinsurgency expert

215
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:32,107
called Martin Nagowski.

216
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,693
But this says he died.

217
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,328
He was killed a year
ago in a mugging.

218
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,781
Pontecorvo believes
the mugging was staged

219
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,316
and Nagowski was assassinated
to prevent him

220
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,151
from revealing
the Red Team's secrets.

221
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:44,837
Okay, you had me until then.

222
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,655
The government doesn't just
go around killing people.

223
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:48,841
It's easy enough to test
Pontecorvo's theory.

224
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:50,676
I'll identify the rest
of the Red Team.

225
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:52,845
If they're alive and well,
we'll move on.

226
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,463
Oh, it's that easy.

227
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,164
You're just going to find
five classified names?

228
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,317
Why not? It's
my day off.

229
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,885
And-and how does
the head of lettuce fit in?

230
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,136
Oh, thank you.

231
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:02,638
I nearly forgot.

232
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:08,944
Can't make soup out of Clyde
until I fatten him up, Watson.

233
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,699
That's sick.

234
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,370
Sherlock feels terribly
about what happened.

235
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:20,539
He'd tell you himself,
but you know how he is.

236
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,992
What would it take
for him to come back?

237
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:25,878
Is it just a matter
of sitting it out

238
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,379
or do you want
a formal apology?

239
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:29,030
You make it sound like he took

240
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:30,532
my favorite shirt
without asking.

241
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,001
Holmes planned to torture
and murder somebody.

242
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:34,870
Sherlock thought that Moran
murdered the woman he loved.

243
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:37,706
Which makes it natural to think
about paying him back.

244
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,059
An employee of this department
does not act on those impulses.

245
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:44,012
Do you want to know
what Sherlock can do? Nothing.

246
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:47,065
And if I had to bet,
I'd say he's not even sorry.

247
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,550
Now, I understand,

248
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,102
you're worried
about your client,

249
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:52,404
you think that he needs
this job to stay sober.

250
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:53,889
I understand that.

251
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:55,724
But he's broken,
and he's broken in a way

252
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:57,159
that has nothing to do

253
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,827
with whether or not
he's getting high.

254
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,414
Oh, speak of the devil.

255
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,416
Hmm.

256
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,868
Writing to say he's sorry?

257
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,788
<i>I'm sorry, I don't</i>

258
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,957
remember him.

259
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:15,410
You want to tell me why

260
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,179
we're in a long-term
care facility in Queens?

261
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,765
I spent the afternoon with
Len Pontecorvo's notes.

262
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,433
Did a little
research of my own.

263
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:23,101
Worked up a
list of names,

264
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,086
people that I'm convinced
were on the Red Team.

265
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:27,272
Carlo Anillo is
one of them.

266
00:10:27,274 --> 00:10:29,691
He booked travel to the town
that houses the War College

267
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:31,193
on the days of the game.

268
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,779
He has a PhD in
Civil Engineering.

269
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:35,364
Hmm.

270
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,698
What's his diagnosis?

271
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,433
He was admitted
earlier in the year

272
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:41,703
with early-onset
Alzheimer's.

273
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,655
By all accounts,
his mind deteriorated

274
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,324
in a matter of weeks.

275
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:48,293
Curiously, no one in his family
has a history of the disease.

276
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,711
That's strange.

277
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:51,830
Almost every early-onset
case is familial.

278
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:54,917
One member of the Red Team
killed in a mugging,

279
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,836
one of them insensate in
a long-term care facility.

280
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:00,055
It's enough to
make one curious.

281
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:02,808
Well, you can't give
someone Alzheimer's.

282
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,793
You said you're with the NYPD?

283
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,294
Most of the
time, yes.

284
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,896
You can talk to him now
if you want.

285
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:10,399
Thank you.

286
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,402
Mr. Anillo.

287
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:14,469
My name is Sherlock.

288
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:16,955
This is my
associate, Joan.

289
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,407
We'd like to ask you
a few questions,

290
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,158
if that's all right.

291
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,660
Sure, if you want.

292
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:24,813
Do you remember
anything about the time

293
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:26,582
just before you came
to the hospital?

294
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:29,084
I'm sorry, no.

295
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,436
Anything about your
work at Columbia?

296
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,640
How about the Army?

297
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,174
You participated
in a war game.

298
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:40,229
My father was in the Marines.

299
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,597
Vietnam.

300
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:45,717
Mr. Anillo.

301
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,686
Mr. Anillo?

302
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,973
I'm sorry, what did you ask me?

303
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:55,027
Does he do this often?

304
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,779
You mean space out?

305
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,648
Sure.
Well, I don't think he's spacing out.

306
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,733
I think he's having
a micro-seizure.

307
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:03,368
I don't think so.

308
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,703
I asked the doctor about it.

309
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:06,738
She said seizures don't happen

310
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,457
to people with that
kind of Alzheimer's

311
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,576
that Carlo has.

312
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:14,796
You're confident
that was a seizure?

313
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,302
You cannot give
someone Alzheimer's,

314
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,537
but you may be able to mimic
its symptoms.

315
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,223
Alzheimer's patients,
they don't have seizures.

316
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:28,209
People who've been poisoned
with domoic acid do.

317
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,762
Domoic acid-- that's what you
find in rotten shellfish.

318
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:32,431
It is also a neurotoxin.

319
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:35,684
It attacks the hippocampus,
the seat of memory in the brain.

320
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,385
You give someone
a large enough dose,

321
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,904
they'd lose virtually
their entire memory.

322
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:41,406
They would appear to be
an Alzheimer's patient.

323
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:43,358
You think someone poisoned
Carlo Anillo?

324
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,910
Why not?

325
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,112
Murder is just one way
to stop someone from talking.

326
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:49,364
This is much more creative.

327
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,667
The beauty is we can test
to see if I'm right.

328
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,535
If Anillo was dosed,

329
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:54,953
we'll know that someone
was targeting

330
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,238
the 2009 members
of the Red Team,

331
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,508
and that that person killed
Len Pontecorvo.

332
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:06,131
We're talking an awful lot
for two guys

333
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,883
who aren't supposed
to be working together.

334
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,818
Shh, listen to me.
It is highly possible

335
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,186
that Len Pontecorvo's murderer

336
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,221
poisoned a man
called Carlo Anillo

337
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:16,224
and murdered someone named
Martin Nagowski, maybe others.

338
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,277
We need to look into a war game
that was conducted in 2009.

339
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,613
No, Holmes, stop talking.

340
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:23,649
We just arrested the guy
that killed Pontecorvo.

341
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,983
I beg your pardon?

342
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,535
Yeah, it's a guy
named Gary Sullivan

343
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:28,436
from the chat room he moderated.

344
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:29,771
They got into a flame war

345
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:32,273
over some moon landing
conspiracy theory.

346
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,326
Sullivan confronted him
in person.

347
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:35,610
Things got out of hand.

348
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:37,112
They guy felt so bad
about what he did,

349
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:38,780
he turned himself in.
I don't know where

350
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,782
this poison stuff
is coming from,

351
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:43,301
but Sullivan didn't mean
to kill Len Pontecorvo.

352
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,836
It was an accident.

353
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,279
Just so
I'm understanding you correctly,

354
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,249
neither of you believe

355
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:58,801
that Neil Armstrong walked
on the moon?

356
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:00,103
Of course not.
That's not the issue.

357
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,222
The issue is who staged
the fake landing.

358
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:07,477
Excuse me.

359
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:11,948
Well, it's obvious that that man

360
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,282
is not the mastermind
of anything.

361
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,218
What are you doing here?

362
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,953
I'm trying to figure out
what happened.

363
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:18,437
Now, Pontecorvo's murder
may have been happenstance.

364
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:19,772
That doesn't mean

365
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,374
that I'm wrong
about the Red Team.

366
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,209
Carlo Anillo was poisoned.

367
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,961
I mean, why are you
in this building

368
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:26,162
when you're suspended?

369
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:27,880
Captain, lives may be at stake.

370
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:30,550
We need to find the members
of the Red Team and warn them.

371
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:32,251
The department
appreciates your tip

372
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:34,337
in leading to the arrest
of Gary Sullivan.

373
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,139
Concerned citizens
such as yourself

374
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,290
play an important role
Why are you talking like that?

375
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,725
in keeping this city safe.

376
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:41,144
Are you listening to me?

377
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,813
Lives are at stake
every day here, Holmes,

378
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:47,984
and yet we had a department
and a city before you got here.

379
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:49,819
You talk your way

380
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,487
into that
interrogation room again,

381
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,941
and I will have you
arrested for trespassing.

382
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,948
Are you okay?

383
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,751
Punishment, as if
that accomplishes anything.

384
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:07,286
Does he really think
that we need

385
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,121
the NYPD's resources
to investigate?

386
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:11,090
Don't we?
Of course we don't.

387
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,658
We'll just trace
the surveillance device

388
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,046
we found at Pontecorvo's home
back to its source.

389
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,852
It's bad enough you're making
me sit in a rental car.

390
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:23,853
Okay, I am not gonna

391
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,170
listen to static anymore.

392
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:26,672
It's my turn to
choose the song.

393
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:29,475
You chose some abysmal racket;
I choose static.

394
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:30,860
I find it conducive to thought.

395
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:33,112
Static is not a song;
it doesn't end.

396
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:37,867
How can you be sure the person
who bugged Pontecorvo's house

397
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,652
is actually gonna
come back for it?

398
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:42,488
If there was one bug in there,
the odds are there are others.

399
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,041
Whoever left it there won't want
to risk someone finding it.

400
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,626
The place was in the hands
of the police

401
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:47,994
until an hour ago,
so they couldn't fetch

402
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:49,095
their things until now.

403
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:50,362
The TV satellite truck

404
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:52,832
that pulled up 20
minutes ago, hmm.

405
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,001
He clearly isn't here
to install anything.

406
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:57,303
So it seems
that he is posing as a worker.

407
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,838
And when he realizes

408
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,506
there is no surveillance device
in the terrarium,

409
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:01,757
we'll simply follow him

410
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,894
back to whoever he works for.

411
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,345
Have you thought
about maybe going

412
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,731
and apologizing
to Captain Gregson?

413
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,117
Might go a long way.
The man is a practiced interrogator.

414
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,652
He knows an insincerity
when he hears one.

415
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,770
There's no part
of you that feels

416
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,857
even a little bad
about what you did?

417
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:17,842
I don't want to discuss this.

418
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,084
Well, sometimes you have
to talk about things that

419
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,145
make you feel uncomfortable.

420
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:21,744
I won't feel uncomfortable;
you will.

421
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:22,346
Why?

422
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:24,331
I'm smarter
than everyone I meet, Watson.

423
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,666
I know it's bad form
to say that,

424
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:28,501
but in my case, it's a fact.

425
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:29,902
Allowances have to be made.

426
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:31,070
Allowances?

427
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:32,255
It's true

428
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,906
I have wronged Captain Gregson.

429
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:36,926
It was the cost of revenge,
and I incurred it willingly.

430
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:38,744
The larger question is

431
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:40,713
how does my suspension
benefit the city?

432
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:42,081
If the role
of the public servant

433
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,849
is to keep an eye
on the greater good,

434
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,184
then why keep me from my work?

435
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:47,136
My work is the greater good.

436
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:50,806
See, you're uncomfortable.

437
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:52,775
Oh, fortunately,

438
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:54,143
we will soon have driving

439
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:55,695
to distract us.

440
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:33,849
Your bug?

441
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:45,477
What is this place?

442
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,446
Howdy.

443
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:49,648
We mostly do business
by appointment here.

444
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,483
Howdy.

445
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:54,036
Thought you might
want this back.

446
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:57,823
What is this place?

447
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,041
NSA? CIA?

448
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,059
Army Intelligence?

449
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:02,511
We do market research.

450
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,015
It's been slow.

451
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:08,500
So, who are you guys, anyway?

452
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:10,002
My name is
Sherlock Holmes.

453
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,771
I am a temporarily
suspended consultant

454
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,222
for the NYPD.

455
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:14,673
This is Joan Watson.

456
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:16,525
She keeps me
from doing heroin.

457
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:17,676
And you would be?

458
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:19,595
Bill.

459
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:21,447
Bill.

460
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:24,650
Well, Bill, we know that the man
who just walked into this office

461
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:26,702
was surveilling Len Pontecorvo.

462
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:28,371
Bob? No, his sister works here.

463
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,622
They're going out to lunch.

464
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:30,856
I also suspect

465
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,241
that this office
is keeping an eye

466
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:34,210
on the 2009 members
of the Red Team.

467
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,361
Red Team?
Yes.

468
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:38,047
Those it hasn't
already attacked yet.

469
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,365
If, in fact,
you are engaged

470
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,201
in a plan to eliminate
those citizens,

471
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,837
I would like you to know
that I know who they are.

472
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,805
Veena Mehta,

473
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,223
professor of anthropology,

474
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:48,924
expert in Middle
Eastern cultures;

475
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,259
Solomon Zyckner,

476
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,311
probability and statistics guru;

477
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,896
Sheldon Frost, the cartographer;

478
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,564
Harold Dresden, mathematician;

479
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,017
Leland Tantowicz,
weapons field expert;

480
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,368
and of course,
Walter McClenahan,

481
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,771
Lieutenant Colonel, retired.

482
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,388
Well, it sounds like
they would make

483
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,490
an interesting dinner party.

484
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:06,325
Mm.

485
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:08,444
I'm gonna make quite certain
that nothing happens to them.

486
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:09,945
Good for you.

487
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:12,915
I got to ask, though.

488
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:16,001
If the Army
or the CIA or whoever

489
00:19:16,003 --> 00:19:18,904
wanted to kill a bunch of people
who did something back in 2009,

490
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,573
why would any of them
still be alive today?

491
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:23,242
It's the Army.

492
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,594
They get some helicopters,
some rocket launchers and stuff,

493
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:28,631
and take care of it
all in one night.

494
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,852
That'd be my advice, anyway.

495
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:34,353
And you can keep that.

496
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:37,807
Never seen it before.

497
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,144
Well, okay.

498
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:43,863
Well, that was either
a waste of time,

499
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:46,315
or I'm gonna be audited every
year for the rest of my life.

500
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,700
Wasn't a waste.

501
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,268
I listed the names
of some of the people

502
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,870
I thought <i>might</i> be
on the Red Team.

503
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,771
Our friend, Bill,
ground his teeth

504
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:54,457
for some names
but not others.

505
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,908
You were testing him?

506
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,793
And now I know
the identities

507
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:00,162
of all of the
team members.

508
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:03,115
Detective Bell, how can I help?

509
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:05,384
So, we just got the results
of the tox screen

510
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,086
we ran on Carlo Anillo.

511
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,555
He was poisoned
with domoic acid.

512
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,390
Gregson wants to hear
everything you know.

513
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:12,925
Happy to oblige,

514
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,810
as long as you'll get me
a visitor's pass.

515
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,134
Walter McClanahan,
systems analyst

516
00:20:22,136 --> 00:20:23,853
and Lieutenant
Colonel retired.

517
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,404
What do you people want?
You're a hard man to find.

518
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:27,273
Six addresses
in two years.

519
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:29,191
Would you come
with me, please?

520
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,251
Something wrong?

521
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:41,453
Who are these people?

522
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:43,606
That's Veena Mehta,
Harold Dresden,

523
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,342
Sheldon Frost, but I
suspect you know that.

524
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:48,711
Gentlemen, Miss Mehta,

525
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:52,331
I know that I'm addressing the
2009 members of the Red Team.

526
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,301
Those of you who are well enough
to be walking around, anyway.

527
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:57,686
I'm a free citizen of the United States;
I'd like to leave now.

528
00:20:57,688 --> 00:20:59,722
Nobody's holding you
here, Mr. McClanahan.

529
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,190
Walt,

530
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,392
these people aren't
with the Army.

531
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:06,028
Let's just, uh,
calm down.

532
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,897
Sit down, huh?

533
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,115
Let's hear what they want.

534
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:16,155
I believe
that you're all in danger.

535
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:20,159
Now, some you may know
that Martin Nagowski is dead.

536
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,410
I believe that
his murder

537
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,412
was planned.

538
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:25,030
I know for a fact

539
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:27,366
that Carlo Anillo
was poisoned.

540
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:28,834
You're here
because the four of you

541
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,336
were brilliant enough
to help develop a plan

542
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:32,871
that paralyzed the Army
with fear.

543
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:35,474
I'm hoping that you might
be able to provide some insight

544
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:37,092
as to who's trying to harm you.

545
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:40,379
We should talk,
but I'm not going first.

546
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:42,565
We took an oath, Sheldon.

547
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,600
If we all talk, nobody
can report anyone else.

548
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:46,252
Saying a single
word to these people

549
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:47,686
is treason.

550
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,078
I'm not comfortable with this.

551
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
This is not something
you can walk away from.

552
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:00,032
I'm very sorry.

553
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,173
We warned them, at least.

554
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:10,175
Maybe one of them
will change their mind,

555
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:11,510
tell us something later.

556
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:14,430
I think maybe one of them
just did.

557
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:33,098
I'm pretty sure you shouldn't
use Clyde as a paperweight.

558
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,483
Hardly think he minds.

559
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:38,537
You shouldn't refer
to it by its name.

560
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,823
It'll just make it harder
to enjoy the soup.

561
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:43,442
Take a look.

562
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:46,712
I've been reviewing past
Red Team exercises.

563
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:48,914
Came across that photograph
quite by accident.

564
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,549
It's the man we met
earlier today.

565
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,101
He introduced
himself as "Bill""

566
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,119
but the caption lists his
name as Todd Clarke.

567
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,922
He was a first lieutenant
when that picture was taken.

568
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:59,024
Could have been captain by 2009.

569
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:01,126
You think he had something to do
with the Red Team exercises?

570
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:02,961
He worked at
the Army War College.

571
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:05,030
He was surveilling Pontecorvo.

572
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:07,650
I think we may have already
found our "Yossarian."

573
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,601
What do you think they found?
Haven't thought about it.

574
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,186
It's my job to find
the murderers.

575
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:12,471
Yeah, but you live in New York.

576
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,223
Their plan to attack it
was so good

577
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:15,574
they made it a national secret.

578
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:17,142
The world is balanced

579
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:18,694
on a knife edge of destruction
every single day.

580
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,779
You accept that, and you can
just get on with things.

581
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,120
Sherlock Holmes?

582
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:30,039
And you would be?
Curious if you know

583
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,674
a man named
Todd Clarke.

584
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,958
Oh, you mean Bill?

585
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,326
We were just
talking about him.

586
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:36,045
Are you in
market research, too?

587
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,846
Sir, you did level
a series of accusations

588
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,181
at him earlier
this afternoon.

589
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:40,632
What's this about?

590
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:42,034
Colonel Clarke was
shot and killed

591
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:43,519
outside his home
earlier this evening.

592
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,854
We're going to need you
to come with us.

593
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,343
You accused Todd Clarke
of masterminding some sort

594
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:59,627
of plot to kill citizens
who allegedly

595
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:01,981
took part in Army war games.

596
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,382
And by 1900 hours,

597
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:04,851
he's dead.

598
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:07,153
You have to admit,
the coincidence is striking.

599
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,756
It's not striking.
It's not even a coincidence.

600
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,525
I suspect that your
Colonel Clarke was killed

601
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:15,161
by the same person who poisoned
Carlo Anillo.

602
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,012
Question is: why?

603
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:18,364
Carlo Anillo is
a private citizen.

604
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:19,899
His poisoning has nothing
to do with this.

605
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:21,284
Yes, so you've said.

606
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:23,703
Clarke was not
a member of the Red Team,

607
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:25,304
but he was Army Intelligence,

608
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,290
and he did teach
at the War College.

609
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,876
Which leads me to believe
that he was "Yossarian,"

610
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:31,127
their liaison during
the exercise.

611
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:32,528
That means that

612
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,363
Clarke knew everything
that the Red Team did.

613
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:36,499
And that makes him dangerous
in the eyes of the killer,

614
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,668
who may or may not have been
affiliated with the government.

615
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,253
Speaking of which,
where were you two

616
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:41,587
at 1900 hours this evening?

617
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:43,673
I'm sorry. Do you think
this is funny?

618
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:46,208
I assure you, I find no levity
in the death of Colonel Clarke.

619
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,844
Then why are you spouting
a bunch of nonsense

620
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:49,044
about government assassinations?

621
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:51,063
You know what?
We're taking you

622
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,715
to INSCOM in Virginia
for further questioning.

623
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,434
What about my alibi?
There are half a dozen

624
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:57,219
security cameras
concealed in my home.

625
00:24:57,221 --> 00:25:00,022
If the two of you would be
kind enough to collect them,

626
00:25:00,024 --> 00:25:02,575
you'll see that I was home
at 7:00 this evening.

627
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:05,828
You told me you were
getting rid of those cameras.

628
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,330
I thought you'd be glad

629
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:09,615
I'm not on my way
to a secret prison.

630
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:12,251
You should have just given them
the tapes at the house.

631
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:14,670
Then I would not have had
to bring them down here.

632
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:16,238
We could have avoided
the whole trip.

633
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,590
I wanted to
take the trip.

634
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,041
I wanted them to
interrogate me

635
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:20,743
so I could
counter-interrogate them.

636
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,762
It worked. Whoever's
killing the Red Team

637
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:24,764
does not work at
that field office.

638
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,599
They thought that I
killed Todd Clarke.

639
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,801
They obviously haven't got
a clue what's going on.

640
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:34,056
No cabbie is gonna stop
if you blow a whistle at them.

641
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:35,725
Cabs have been hailed this way
for decades

642
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,277
because this is the most
efficient way to hail a cab.

643
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,780
The murder of Todd Clarke
makes me more certain than ever

644
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:42,398
that someone is killing anyone
with knowledge

645
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,099
of the Red Team's plans.

646
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,285
I'm just not certain
it's Army Intelligence anymore.

647
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,790
Who else knew the names
of the Red Team?

648
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,575
See? Not stopping.

649
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:54,961
The list could have worked
its way up the chain of command.

650
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:56,612
It could have leaked
to another agency.

651
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:58,113
Then, of course, there's
the Red Team themselves.

652
00:25:58,115 --> 00:25:59,715
Why would they
pick themselves off?

653
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:01,250
No obvious reason.

654
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:03,502
Who are you calling?
It's time for the police

655
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:06,556
to take the rest of the team
into protective custody.

656
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:08,674
Taxi!

657
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:18,517
Mr. McClenahan?

658
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:31,247
Mr. McClenahan?

659
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:36,953
Mr. McClenahan?

660
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:38,671
Are you in there?

661
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,509
Mr. McClenahan?

662
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:57,807
How's Polk and Mahone?

663
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,859
They're lucky those shells
were filled with rock salt.

664
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:01,694
They're gonna be
laid up for a while,

665
00:27:01,696 --> 00:27:04,447
but they'll be okay.
Super, too.

666
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:08,067
That contraption's not the only
weapon we found in the place.

667
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:13,022
Assault rifles, knives and
a nine-millimeter pistol.

668
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,508
Todd Clarke was
killed with a nine-millimeter.

669
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,960
We're gonna run
a comparison ballistics test,

670
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:20,496
but I'd say we found
ourselves a suspect.

671
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:24,133
Holmes says he's on his way.

672
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:26,035
Now, I didn't call him.

673
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:28,721
Who's texting him pictures
of the crime scene?

674
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:31,841
He probably called in a favor
from one of the CSU guys.

675
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:33,809
I'll figure it out.

676
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:36,979
We put a BOLO out
on McClenahan. Hopefully...

677
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,067
Hopefully he hasn't
left town yet...

678
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:43,402
Sorry.

679
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:44,887
Says he found McClenahan.

680
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:47,106
What?
Yeah.

681
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,724
How'd you find him so fast?

682
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:51,110
I didn't. I just needed
you to answer the phone.

683
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:52,561
Are the others safe?

684
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,613
Yeah. Mehta and Frost are
at the hotel already.

685
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:56,732
Dresden, I guess,
has taken a while to pack,

686
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:58,417
but he's got our people
with him.

687
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,953
I'm not coming there any longer.
Don't wait for me.

688
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:03,039
We're not waiting
for you.

689
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,175
Probably be easier
to fire the guy

690
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:07,793
if we ever
actually paid him.

691
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:16,302
Mr. Dresden, I was
surprised to hear

692
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:18,253
that you hadn't gone
to the hotel.

693
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:21,357
Oh, I'm-- They said
we're okay for a bit.

694
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,693
There isn't much we can do
quickly these days.

695
00:28:23,695 --> 00:28:27,396
She has
limb-onset A.L.S.

696
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:29,098
Two years now.

697
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,067
We're here because Walter
McClenahan has emerged

698
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:33,486
as a suspect in the
Red Team murders.

699
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:36,939
You think Walt did this?

700
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:39,442
I noticed that you and
he had a certain...

701
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:41,877
uh, connection; he
seemed to listen to you.

702
00:28:51,304 --> 00:28:53,455
Yeah, sure,
I got to know Walt.

703
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:56,675
He's weird,
but he's brilliant.

704
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:58,627
We stayed in touch.

705
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:02,481
I guess we became... friends.

706
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:04,350
I think I may be
his only friend.

707
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:05,851
Then help us
find him.

708
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:08,154
If he's not the killer,
he's in danger.

709
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,489
If he is, we need
to get him into custody

710
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:11,941
before he hurts anyone else.

711
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:13,576
I noticed you didn't

712
00:29:13,578 --> 00:29:16,829
exactly howl in protest when
I mentioned he was a suspect.

713
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:18,647
Without going into specifics,

714
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:23,369
the plan we came up with
back in '09 was...

715
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:25,421
disturbing.

716
00:29:25,423 --> 00:29:28,407
It's a lot to live with,

717
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:30,509
and it did different things
to all of us.

718
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:33,379
I got back in touch
with my brother.

719
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:35,714
I started going to church again.

720
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:39,251
Walt went in
a different direction.

721
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:44,523
See, there are people who want
to know what we found out.

722
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:48,444
Bad people.

723
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:50,312
And Walt was convinced that

724
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:52,114
someone was gonna
sell our secret.

725
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:56,735
He used to joke that he might
as well be the one to do it.

726
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:58,854
And after Nagowski got killed,

727
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:01,523
Walt told me
to look on the bright side.

728
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:02,875
Every time one of us dies,

729
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:04,710
there are fewer people
to sell the plan.

730
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:06,462
That makes it worth
more and more.

731
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:09,882
I thought he was kidding.

732
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,867
He was trying to
drive up the price.

733
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:13,552
With the Red Team dead,
any potential buyer

734
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:16,038
would have to come to him;
he could charge a fortune.

735
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,557
Mm. You have an idea
where he is, don't you?

736
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,678
Yeah. He bought some land
out in New Jersey.

737
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,263
He built a bunker there.

738
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:31,320
McClenahan may be in
a bunker in New Jersey.

739
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:33,856
No, he's not.
We just found him.

740
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:35,741
And he's definitely
not our killer.

741
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:41,413
A homeless guy found him

742
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:42,665
a little while ago.

743
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,667
He was shot once
in the back of the head

744
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:45,901
about 24 hours ago.

745
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:48,621
Then the killer
dragged him over here.

746
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:50,923
Left him like that.

747
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,625
Where's your shadow, anyway?

748
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:54,176
Harold Dresden's wife is sick.

749
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:56,795
She's helping him
get her ready for travel.

750
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,518
What are these
aquamarine fibers on his shirt?

751
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,253
Oh, yeah.
The killer draped a blanket

752
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:05,721
over McClenahan's face
and torso.

753
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:07,606
The patrolman removed it
to check his vitals

754
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:09,258
when he arrived on the scene.

755
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,752
He covered his face?
You're sure?

756
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:11,361
Mm-hmm.

757
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:15,097
That's more care than he took
with any of his other victims.

758
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:19,151
Suggests an element
of shame here.

759
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,487
McClenahan was killed
by someone he knew.

760
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:23,322
The guy didn't seem
like a social butterfly.

761
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:25,207
He had one friend.

762
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,626
We need to get to the hotel
where the Red Team's gathered.

763
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:29,078
Why?

764
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,330
I think the killer
may already be there.

765
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:38,337
Well, it ain't much,
I know, but it's safe.

766
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:41,307
Detective, any word
on whether they found Walt?

767
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:43,559
I don't know how long
Sheila can stay here.

768
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:46,795
Nah, I haven't heard anything
yet, but we're on the case.

769
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:48,964
Are the others already here?

770
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:51,100
Yeah, the department
took the whole floor.

771
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:55,187
Ah, that works perfectly.
Thank you.

772
00:32:20,963 --> 00:32:23,398
Mr. Dresden! Freeze!

773
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,891
Is everyone all right?

774
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,126
We think so.

775
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,461
After you called in
the warning,

776
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:38,896
one of our guys
interrupted Dresden

777
00:32:38,898 --> 00:32:40,964
just as he was about
to shoot Veena Mehta.

778
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:43,067
We got the rest
of the Red Team out,

779
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,968
but he nabbed
one of our detectives.

780
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,638
Holding him hostage
in the room.

781
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,657
If Harold Dresden intended
to sell the Red Team's plans,

782
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:51,158
the motive
would be money.

783
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,327
He planned to kill the
other two team members

784
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:55,362
in a hotel full
of policemen?

785
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,364
That's not something one
typically walks away from.

786
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:59,166
Doesn't sound like he plans
to go anywhere.

787
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:00,668
Our negotiator called
the room phone.

788
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,002
Dresden gave us his demands.

789
00:33:02,004 --> 00:33:04,088
Usually a guy wants a helicopter
or a bus.

790
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,506
He just wants the rest

791
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,324
of the surviving Red Team
delivered to him.

792
00:33:07,326 --> 00:33:08,626
Then he'll let our guy out.

793
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:09,927
He's on a
suicide mission.

794
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:10,893
I need to speak with him.

795
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:13,412
That guy is holed up in there
with one of my detectives.

796
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:17,566
I'm not putting this in the
hands of a suspended consultant.

797
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,418
Captain, I know why Dresden
is doing this,

798
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,587
and I know what to say
to make him stop.

799
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:22,955
I understand
what's at stake here.

800
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,540
I'll get your man out safely.

801
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:43,559
Are they here?

802
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:45,227
I think not.

803
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:46,762
Why are <i>you</i> calling?

804
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:48,781
Can you keep a secret,
Mr. Dresden?

805
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:50,932
Most people say yes
when you ask them that,

806
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:54,403
but all they really want is
for you to give them the dish.

807
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:57,439
In your case, though, I'd say
that you'd earned the right

808
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:58,707
to answer in the affirmative.

809
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,442
I have no idea
what this is about,

810
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:02,127
but I already told
the police what I want.

811
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:04,546
Bring me Veena and Frost.

812
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:05,998
Or I shoot this detective.

813
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,950
I think we both know
that you won't do that.

814
00:34:08,952 --> 00:34:11,086
Just as we both know
the only person

815
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:13,005
presently in that room
that you intend to harm

816
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:14,907
is yourself, Mr. Dresden.

817
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,892
How could you
possibly know that?

818
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:19,144
Let me in. Let's talk about it.

819
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:24,650
If you hear what I've got to say
and you're still in the mood

820
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:28,654
for violence, then I'll
leave you to your standoff.

821
00:34:30,357 --> 00:34:33,442
I'm quite unarmed.

822
00:34:43,336 --> 00:34:45,120
That's better.

823
00:34:45,122 --> 00:34:48,624
I prefer a face-to-face,
don't you?

824
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:50,209
Mind if I get something
from the minibar?

825
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:52,428
NYPD's buying.

826
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:03,338
Uh, my sober companion
couldn't make the trip up here.

827
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,393
But I suppose I should forgo
alcohol all the same.

828
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:09,111
You said you wanted
to talk.

829
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:10,562
So sit down and talk.

830
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:20,489
I judge people
by their behavior.

831
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:22,374
And your behavior can only lead
to one conclusion.

832
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,159
You're clearly not interested
in profit.

833
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:27,212
You just want to be certain
that no one learns the plan

834
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:29,197
the six of you
came up with.

835
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,400
You're convinced
it's gonna get out.

836
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:33,152
And that when it's enacted,
thousands,

837
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:36,839
maybe hundreds of thousands
of deaths will result.

838
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:40,876
But if everyone who knows
the plan is dead or stripped

839
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:43,178
of their memory,
that can never happen.

840
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,514
The math's really
quite straightforward.

841
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,616
Six of you,
plus your Army contact--

842
00:35:47,618 --> 00:35:49,718
seven lives versus thousands.

843
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,521
You worked slowly at first, you
disguised what you were doing.

844
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:55,908
Then I start asking questions,
you have to speed things up.

845
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,862
Fortunately, for you, after
Todd Clarke was murdered,

846
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:03,916
we brought all of your remaining
targets to this hotel.

847
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:06,251
One thing I can't
work out, though,

848
00:36:06,253 --> 00:36:09,788
is why you became so certain
the plan would leak.

849
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,509
You didn't start killing
for two years

850
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:15,144
after the war game.

851
00:36:18,348 --> 00:36:20,966
Two years ago...

852
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:26,889
That's when Sheila

853
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:30,809
woke up one morning and
told me she felt this

854
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:33,612
twitching in her hand.

855
00:36:33,614 --> 00:36:35,981
You know much about
the progression of A.L.S.?

856
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:38,150
You lose about two percent
of your body's functions

857
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,219
every month.

858
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:41,320
Two years in,

859
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:43,622
all I can do is

860
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:46,291
try to keep her
from getting bed sores.

861
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:50,629
I'd been approached before
about selling our plan.

862
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:53,549
I think we all had
cryptic e-mails,

863
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:56,668
strangers coming up
to you in the subway.

864
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,221
Who'd they represent?

865
00:36:59,223 --> 00:37:00,589
They never said.

866
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:04,309
One of them did say
he could help Sheila

867
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:06,228
if I talked to him.

868
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,780
It was two years ago.

869
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:10,566
Yeah, right when
she first got sick.

870
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:14,736
I knew he was lying, of course.

871
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:16,905
But even so, I spent days

872
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:19,691
thinking about it.

873
00:37:19,693 --> 00:37:23,278
If he'd been able
to do a thing for her,

874
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,331
I'd have told them
everything I know.

875
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:33,872
See, everyone's got
that one thing, don't they?

876
00:37:33,874 --> 00:37:37,342
Some weakness that could
lead you to betray

877
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:39,678
every principle
you ever had.

878
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,881
The thing we created had value.

879
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:45,050
And I realized it was
only a matter of time

880
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:46,718
until someone
put a price on it.

881
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,221
So you made arrangements
for your wife's care.

882
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:51,023
Got down to business.

883
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:55,027
So, you figured out my plan--
congratulations.

884
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:57,529
And thank you
for helping me enact it.

885
00:37:57,531 --> 00:38:00,482
When I only had one policeman
in here, I had no leverage.

886
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:03,318
Now, once I shoot you,
they'll realize

887
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,186
I'm serious about
killing that detective.

888
00:38:05,188 --> 00:38:07,522
They'll give me
what I want.

889
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:10,626
Eight lives versus thousands.

890
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:12,878
Math still works.

891
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,013
I'm amazed you still
haven't worked it out.

892
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:17,716
There really is no such
thing as a secret.

893
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:19,635
The plan,

894
00:38:19,637 --> 00:38:21,203
it's in a memo.

895
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:22,921
It's been e-mailed
back and forth.

896
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,040
It was labeled "For eyes only."

897
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:28,143
No one but the White House
Situation Room has access to it.

898
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:29,728
I know what it is.
You do not!

899
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,212
I do.

900
00:38:31,214 --> 00:38:33,381
I worked it out
hours after taking the case.

901
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:37,236
And before you pull that
trigger, you should know,

902
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:39,922
I told a colleague.

903
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:42,074
I wrote it down.

904
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:46,995
Your secret is out.

905
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:51,166
If you're telling the truth...

906
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:54,953
...that's checkmate.

907
00:38:56,706 --> 00:38:58,607
So...

908
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:03,879
What's the plan?

909
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:15,691
Don't move!
Alright, hands behind your back.

910
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,761
Detective okay?

911
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:21,647
All good!

912
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:24,066
You okay?

913
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:26,618
How did you get
Dresden to come out?

914
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,156
Well, I knew the Red Team's
plan, and I told him that.

915
00:39:31,158 --> 00:39:33,108
How did you figure that out?

916
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,776
I thought very quickly
and very carefully.

917
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:35,961
You mean you guessed?

918
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:37,663
Well... I had a notion

919
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:40,082
as to the Red Team's
strategy, I just...

920
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:41,633
chose the most likely one.

921
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:45,170
Gun to one's head,
very powerful stimulus.

922
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:48,557
Captain, I think that you and I
owe each other a conversation.

923
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,177
I got to deal with this.

924
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:57,516
There's a place called McNabb's
at 43rd and 12th.

925
00:39:57,518 --> 00:39:59,568
Meet me there in an hour.

926
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:05,524
♪

927
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:15,834
I'm not really supposed to be
spending much time in bars.

928
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:17,336
Well, tonight is
not about you.

929
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:19,154
If I'm gonna have
this conversation,

930
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:22,507
I'm gonna have a drink
to go with it.

931
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:26,345
I regret that
circumstances caused me

932
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:29,931
to endanger our relationship.

933
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:32,834
It was a price I was willing
to pay for revenge.

934
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:35,103
As was the likelihood
of going to prison.

935
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,889
As it turns out,
there's no revenge to be had.

936
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:40,409
Given that,
it serves no one's interest

937
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:42,177
for you to keep me
from my work.

938
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:43,929
Who the hell are you?

939
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,147
I beg your pardon?

940
00:40:45,149 --> 00:40:46,514
'Cause obviously,
you're not

941
00:40:46,516 --> 00:40:47,899
the person I
thought you were.

942
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:49,518
I don't know how
to answer that question.

943
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,453
You don't let anyone
into your life

944
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:52,654
that's not constantly
concerned with you.

945
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:54,656
What kind of
mood you're in,

946
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:56,324
whether you're
getting high or not,

947
00:40:56,326 --> 00:40:58,960
whether you're gonna
work like an adult

948
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:01,329
or throw a
temper tantrum.

949
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,701
You know what?

950
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:08,837
Most of the time,
you're worth it,

951
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:11,873
because you
are special.

952
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,642
Damned if you
don't know it.

953
00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:16,478
But you are.

954
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,263
You want to
work cases?

955
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:20,399
You're right.

956
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:23,902
I can't say no.

957
00:41:25,938 --> 00:41:29,491
Don't think for a minute
that I'm ever gonna forget

958
00:41:29,493 --> 00:41:34,413
that you were planning to
murder someone on my watch.

959
00:41:34,415 --> 00:41:38,083
And don't think that I'm ever
gonna really trust you again.

960
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:39,835
You don't need
to trust me to benefit

961
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:41,503
from my intellect, do you?

962
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:43,255
No, I don't.

963
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:46,675
But I do need to get
something out of my system.

964
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:53,515
Welcome back.

965
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:00,593
WATSON
Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

966
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:03,762
Um, how'd it go?

967
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:07,566
Well, I've been reinstated.

968
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:09,985
Well, you don't
sound too happy.

969
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:14,823
Are you eating soup?

970
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:17,392
I was hungry.

971
00:42:17,394 --> 00:42:20,913
Please tell me
you didn't cook Clyde.

972
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:27,786
The soup is split pea.

973
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:31,423
These are magnificent creatures.

974
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:34,710
Clyde will likely
outlive both of us.

975
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:39,581
You didn't really think
I would eat him, did you?

976
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:43,519
I don't know. I guess it's hard
to know what you're gonna do.

977
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,938
You want to tell me
what happened with Gregson?

978
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,726
All right. Good night.

979
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:55,728
