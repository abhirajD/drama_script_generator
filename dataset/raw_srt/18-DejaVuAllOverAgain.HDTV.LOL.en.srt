1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,399
(violin plays classical music)

2
00:00:11,873 --> 00:00:14,458
(subway train approaching)

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,261
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

4
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:30,107
(passing train clattering)

5
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:41,768
Roses, a dozen.

6
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,454
(laughing):
I know.

7
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,739
He said he was heading to his
girlfriend's house

8
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,241
and she cancelled on him.

9
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:48,775
No, didn't even tell me
his name.

10
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:50,744
Just said he didn't want them
to go to waste.

11
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,246
(train approaching)

12
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:53,464
It was nice.

13
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,883
It's been a lousy week.

14
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:58,585
Maybe things
are finally turning around.

15
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:01,572
(woman screams,
train horn blasts)

16
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:03,507
Tragic news out of Manhattan
this evening,

17
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,744
where a young woman was pushed
in front of a subway train.

18
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:08,762
JOAN:
Seriously, you guys have, like,

19
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:09,980
the cutest
kids in New York.

20
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:11,098
KEN:
It's true.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,099
(laughing)

22
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:13,633
Who knew these
guys back in college

23
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,602
would be
such a baby factory?

24
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,070
Me, I did.

25
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:19,323
Right after I caught
them having sex in my bed.

26
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:20,441
One time, freshman year.

27
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:21,575
You must move on.

28
00:01:21,577 --> 00:01:23,026
Yeah, and let's be honest,

29
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,578
that is the most action that
bed saw all year.

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,746
Ouch.

31
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:27,614
Are you going
to be able to make it

32
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:28,949
to Sammy's
birthday party on Saturday?

33
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:30,451
2:00, yes.

34
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,252
I am wrapping up
with my client on Friday

35
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:34,338
and I may be able
to help and come set up.

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,706
How is that going,
by the way?

37
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,491
The companionship thing.

38
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:40,043
If by "thing",
you mean career,

39
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:42,045
it is going really well.

40
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:45,466
I-I-I don't know, I've
worked with some amazing people.

41
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:47,301
I think it's incredible,
what you're doing.

42
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:49,186
I mean, you walk away from
being a doctor,

43
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:50,670
find a new way to help people?

44
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,272
Same old Jo.

45
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:54,308
Sweet.

46
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,309
To Joan.
To Joan.

47
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,343
And the baby.

48
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:59,530
OTHERS:
And the baby!

49
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:02,483
(ringtone playing)

50
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:04,651
Oh, sorry, guys, this is,
um, one of the rehab facilities

51
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,203
that, um, refers me
to other clients.

52
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:07,354
I should take it.

53
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:08,688
I'll be right back.

54
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,825
This is Joan Watson.

55
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:15,045
Joan, this is
Dr. Caruso at Hemdale.

56
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,030
I sent you a case file
a little while ago.

57
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,665
I was wondering if you had
a chance to look at it?

58
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,251
JOAN:
I'm just opening it right now.

59
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,803
DR. CARUSO:
The patient in question

60
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,538
completes his stay with us
on Monday.

61
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,374
His father expressed some
concerns about life post-rehab,

62
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,977
so, I recommended a companion.

63
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,179
He looked at some resumes
and chose you.

64
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:35,265
So, can I tell him
the interest is mutual?

65
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,651
Sure, I just have one question.

66
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:39,853
Uh, what kind of name
is Sherlock?

67
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:57,871
(car alarm blaring)

68
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:01,925
(sighs)

69
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,714
(sighs heavily)

70
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,885
(car alarm continues)

71
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:14,471
(sighs)

72
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:17,190
(quietly):
I can't do this.

73
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:18,392
Ah, just shut it off.

74
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,260
(car alarm chirps,
wailing stops)

75
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:21,812
Can't let
the noise get to you.

76
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:23,763
You know this.
I know.

77
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:25,949
But you did better
with the lock this time.

78
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,202
It only took you six seconds.

79
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:30,770
How weird is this?

80
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:31,872
You're Sherlock's sponsor

81
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,490
and I'm his sober--

82
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,076
well, I <i>was</i> his sober
companion-- until recently.

83
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,872
And now you're teaching me
how to break into cars.

84
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,090
You want to do
the kind of work he does.

85
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:42,876
Besides, every hour
I spend with you,

86
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:44,577
he's got to do two with me.

87
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,045
How's that going?

88
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,046
He's good.

89
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,348
He's in a good place.

90
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,216
Happier since you
decided to work with him.

91
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:52,135
(phone blips)

92
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,639
Hey, I gotta go.

93
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,225
I'll give you a ride.

94
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,198
HOLMES:
Dreadful news:

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,399
I heard from my father
this morning.

96
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,567
Really?

97
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:08,785
Not the man himself,
of course.

98
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:10,320
One of his minions.

99
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:12,104
Apparently, he's holding me
to the bargain

100
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:14,123
that we struck when I borrowed
that pittance from him.

101
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,075
If you're referring
to the $2.2 million

102
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,611
that you borrowed to pay off
the kidnapping ransom,

103
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,079
I'd say that's a
little more than a pittance.

104
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,464
I foiled that kidnapper.

105
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,799
Every penny was accounted for
and returned.

106
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,116
Yeah, but still.

107
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:25,301
You're off his teats now,
Watson,

108
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:26,836
you can stop taking his side.

109
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:28,454
What did he want?

110
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:30,890
Uh, to meet with
one of his many attorneys

111
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:34,477
this morning and discuss work
of an investigative nature.

112
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,480
Knowing Father, the man
is a shyster's shyster.

113
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,148
You know, Dad once
helped defending a client

114
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,068
who was equal parts
Adolf Hitler and Bernie Madoff.

115
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,987
Hey, does your father
know that I'm still here

116
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:45,104
and that we're
working together now?

117
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,356
Why would he care?

118
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:47,774
I don't know,
I was just curious.

119
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,659
You're an aspiring
detective now, Watson.

120
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:52,144
Apply your
curiosity to your cases.

121
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,599
Impressive.

122
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,451
I know; I could look
at this all day.

123
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:00,503
No, I was talking
about the glass.

124
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,672
It's... bullet-proof.

125
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:05,591
Six-inch glass-clad
polycarbonate, hmm.

126
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:07,787
ATTORNEY:
Mr. Holmes.

127
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,372
Philip Armistead.

128
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:10,522
Do you know that "shyster"

129
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:13,909
is German for
"one who defecates"?

130
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,463
And this is
my assistant Rebecca.

131
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,749
So, let's cut to the proverbial
chase, shall we?

132
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,467
How much slime
will my associate and I

133
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:23,219
have to wade through in order
to help you?

134
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,970
My father said you were
in need of my services.

135
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:27,706
You're an attorney, you work
for him, he values you:

136
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,141
three good reasons to assume

137
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,227
that the work we will have to do
will be vile.

138
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,481
Actually, I was hoping you
might be able to help Rebecca.

139
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,183
My sister Callie...

140
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:39,268
she went missing
almost six months ago.

141
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,771
I'm worried her husband may
have done something to her.

142
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:50,913
Uh, I guess I should start with
"I'm sorry."

143
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,099
I hate that I can't say these
things to you face-to-face.

144
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:54,367
It's just...

145
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:59,839
I don't love you anymore, Drew.

146
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,509
And it hurts to say that,
you don't know how much.

147
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:07,012
I care about you,
I want you to be happy,

148
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,882
but I need to be happy, too.

149
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,517
And I thought that
I could tough it out

150
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,053
and give us both
a little more time.

151
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:16,856
But then that woman got pushed
in front of a subway train

152
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:19,475
the other day-- the woman with
the flowers--

153
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:22,528
and, I don't know, I couldn't
stop thinking about her.

154
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,763
Life is too short
to stay with someone

155
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:26,732
who doesn't make you happy.

156
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:30,503
So, uh, I'm going to go away
for a little while.

157
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,688
I don't know where and I-I don't
know for how long.

158
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,457
I just know
that I need some time.

159
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,293
Maybe, someday, you'll find it

160
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,295
in your heart to forgive me.

161
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:44,083
When my brother-in-law Drew
first showed me the video,

162
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:45,551
I didn't question it.

163
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,220
Callie had always
been a little fragile.

164
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:50,389
Packing up her stuff
and hiding out for a while,

165
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,957
that sounded like her.

166
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,094
But then after the days started
turning into weeks,

167
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,562
I got suspicious.

168
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,681
The marriage
was... troubled?

169
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,466
Callie had left him once before.

170
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:01,517
That was about a
year and a half ago.

171
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,018
What happened?

172
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,187
I don't know.
Callie didn't even tell me

173
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,605
she'd done it
till a few weeks later,

174
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,140
and by then,
she and Drew were back together.

175
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:10,526
And I tried to
get her to talk about it,

176
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,811
but she said it
was all in the past.

177
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:14,163
She was like that--

178
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:15,915
she kept everything
bottled up; private.

179
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:18,484
So, when she
didn't return my phone calls

180
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:21,036
after Drew showed me the video,
I wasn't surprised.

181
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,655
After a few weeks,
Rebecca went to the police.

182
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:26,375
They tried to locate
Callie via her cell phone,

183
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,593
credit card,
e-mail records,

184
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:29,512
but they came up empty.

185
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:32,381
She hadn't used any of them
since before she disappeared.

186
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,884
They questioned Drew, but
he managed to convince them

187
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:36,218
the video was authentic.

188
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,387
Oh, you-you
think it's a fake?

189
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,440
I think things were bad between
Drew and my sister.

190
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,225
He could've forced her
to make the video

191
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,777
so that,
after he killed her,

192
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,946
he could show it to the police
and convince them

193
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:48,147
that she'd run away.

194
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:49,482
Which he did.

195
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:50,816
There's also the trunk.

196
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,537
It was our grandmother's.

197
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,689
My father willed
it to me before he died.

198
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:59,325
My apartment
is tiny, so I let Callie

199
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:00,543
keep it at her place.

200
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:01,794
The deal was,

201
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:04,079
she would give it
to me if I ever moved.

202
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,548
The first time that I went

203
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,216
to see Drew
after she disappeared,

204
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:09,585
I realized that
the trunk was gone, too.

205
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,136
He claimed that
she took it with her,

206
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:12,721
but I know that
she would never do that.

207
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:15,374
I told the police that I think
he did what he did.

208
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,426
And he used the
trunk to get rid of her.

209
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:18,727
I've had the firm's
top investigators

210
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:20,312
on this for months.

211
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,714
They haven't managed to
come up with anything.

212
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:24,049
I happened to speak with
your father the other day,

213
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:26,185
and he recommended
I reach out to you.

214
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:28,270
Would you excuse us
for just one moment?

215
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:30,022
Come on.

216
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,690
That woman
could not be more wrong

217
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,108
about her sister's video.

218
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,277
It was most certainly
not made under duress.

219
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,829
Tell me.

220
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,581
The human face, Watson,
is like the penis.

221
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,898
Or so said the great

222
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,534
personality theorist
Silvan Tomkins.

223
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,035
The point being:

224
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:44,753
the face,
like the male member,

225
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:46,589
has a mind of its own;
it betrays us

226
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,908
on an almost daily basis;
advertises our secrets

227
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,260
to those
who know that to look for.

228
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:52,845
The woman in that video
was utterly calm

229
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,380
when she filmed it.

230
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,549
More than that, I think she was
excited to move on.

231
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,851
You and I were not
looking at the same video.

232
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,052
Her jaw muscles
were relaxed, not tight.

233
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,353
Her nose wings
were not dilated.

234
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,555
She wasn't going
off some script,

235
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,223
she meant every
word she was saying.

236
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:05,160
Nose wings.

237
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:06,610
We have an opportunity
here, Watson.

238
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:09,028
More precisely, you do.

239
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,814
I think this would make
an excellent first case for you.

240
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,650
You want me to find Callie
Burrell on my own?

241
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,702
Every good investigator needs
to be able to find people

242
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,237
who do not wish to be found.

243
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,655
More often than not,
those are dangerous criminals.

244
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:23,576
Ms. Burrell is merely a wife
grown tired of her husband.

245
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,244
It's a case
with training wheels.

246
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:27,046
You can't be sure
that Callie is okay.

247
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:28,614
And, you know what,
th-th-there might be something

248
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,049
to what her sister is saying.

249
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:33,285
Maybe, maybe not.
Your job to find out.

250
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,721
Is this because the case
came through your father?

251
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:38,457
No, it's because the case
suits you.

252
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,960
Besides, I have one of my own
which I wish to take up.

253
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:45,797
Oh, that's the woman that Callie
mentioned in her video.

254
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,150
She was murdered
just days before Callie

255
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,402
quote-unquote vanished.

256
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:52,104
The man who pushed her
was never found.

257
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:54,490
I lost a valued informant
to a pusher back in London

258
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,609
Ugly business, yeah.

259
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:58,410
As horrific a death
as you can imagine.

260
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:00,079
Now, I found that killer.

261
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,498
I suspect I can
find this one as well.

262
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Hey, aren't
you going to tell

263
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,168
your father's friend what we're doing?
Your case now, Watson.

264
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,486
You tell him.

265
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:11,511

HOLMES: I must confess,
I'm quite embarrassed

268
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:26,415
this murder escaped my attention
when it first transpired.

269
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,850
I was still locked away in
Hemdale at the time.

270
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:31,319
"Locked away" is
a little exaggerated.

271
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,921
When in days of my arrival,

272
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,090
the staff forbade me access
to newspapers.

273
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,143
Something about
police blotters riling me.

274
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:40,896
No, you?
Curious case, this one.

275
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,046
Man approaches woman.

276
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,598
Man gives woman flowers.

277
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,601
And walks away,
only to return moments later

278
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:49,488
and push woman
in front of train.

279
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,523
It's pretty obvious
the guy's a psychopath.

280
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,408
Likely, yeah.

281
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,610
Obvious, no.

282
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:58,346
He takes great care
to keep his face

283
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:01,032
angled away from the platform
security cameras.

284
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:03,452
Speaks to premeditation.

285
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,203
He'd been to the platform before
and cased it.

286
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:08,573
Psychopaths can't premeditate?
No, of course they can.

287
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:11,409
But tube pushers
tend to be lunatics

288
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:13,261
of the raving variety.

289
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,346
They're sloppy.

290
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,765
This man was the opposite.

291
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:19,384
Good news is...

292
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:24,255
...I know exactly
what he looks like.

293
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,774
Look, I can't tell

294
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,776
if you're kidding
right now or not.

295
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,260
I reached out

296
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:30,595
to the witnesses
who helped generate

297
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:31,780
that sketch--
completely useless,

298
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,431
especially with regards
to the patch

299
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:36,201
he has on his jacket here--
looks like some sort of logo.

300
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,619
I can't tell
what it is.

301
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,237
You think you can find
the guy from a patch?

302
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,573
(sighs) Stranger
things, Watson.

303
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,107
How goes the search

304
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,826
for father's lawyer's
assistant's sister?

305
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,212
(sighs) Well...
I went through

306
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,246
everything that
the firm's investigators

307
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,714
have put together,
and so far, nothing.

308
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:51,583
I mean, if she's really
hiding from her husband,

309
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,168
she's doing a bang-up job.

310
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,620
I can see why the police
called off the search.

311
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:57,012
Have you spoken
to the husband yet?

312
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,057
No, I called

313
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:00,058
his art gallery today,
and he's out of town.

314
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,978
I'm gonna pop in tomorrow and do
my best Columbo impression.

315
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:05,296
He was a...

316
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:07,933
Never mind.

317
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,467
I'm excited for you.

318
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:11,403
When you talk to him,
you'll identify yourself

319
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,405
as a "consulting detective."

320
00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:15,240
You haven't done that before.
I...

321
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:17,325
(ringtone playing)

322
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:20,812
(whispers):
Oh, no.

323
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,781
(groans):
Carver and Sons.

324
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,850
8:00, I was
supposed to meet you.

325
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:27,869
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say you forgot.

326
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:29,504
It's okay. It's not like
Look, Em, I...

327
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:32,073
you forgot to meet me
the last time we made plans.

328
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:34,309
Oh, no, wait, you did.

329
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:37,229
Let me make it up to you--
uh, tomorrow, my treat.

330
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:40,415
I don't know, Joan.
Come on. I feel awful.

331
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:41,650
(rock music playing)

332
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:43,268
Know what? Yeah.

333
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,570
Tomorrow should work.
I'll see you at 8:00.

334
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,672
Okay, great.
I'll see you then.

335
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:49,140
(hangs up)

336
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:50,892
(sighs)

337
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:54,696
Mr. Gardner?
Hi. I'm Joan Watson.

338
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:56,064
I'm consulting, uh...

339
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,233
I-I'm assisting
with an investigation

340
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,485
into the disappearance
of your wife.

341
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,988
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions?

342
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,574
Of course. Come in.

343
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,036
I thought Callie leaving

344
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,712
me was the worst thing
that could ever happen.

345
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:12,080
I was wrong-- the
worst part was...

346
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,198
realizing Rebecca
thought I'd hurt her.

347
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,418
Do you think it's strange
that Callie hasn't tried

348
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,553
to contact you or Rebecca
since she left?

349
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,539
Yeah. (soft chuckle)

350
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,207
I guess I do.

351
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:26,061
But... do I find it stranger
than her packing her things

352
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:27,879
and sending me a
Dear John letter

353
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:30,181
in the form of a video? No.

354
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:32,216
She's always
been a very...

355
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:34,218
complicated person.

356
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,072
Rebecca mentioned that
Callie left you once before?

357
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,057
About a year and half ago.

358
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,860
It was just for a couple
of days, but still...

359
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,411
it was devastating.

360
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:45,697
That time she
called me.

361
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,866
I begged her to come home.
I told her

362
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,085
whatever was bothering her,
we could work it out.

363
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:53,371
I guess I got through to her,
because... she came back.

364
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,623
If you don't mind me asking,

365
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,007
what <i>were</i> the problems
between you?

366
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,208
I don't know.

367
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,877
The first time she left,
it was like

368
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,545
being hit over the head
with a club.

369
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,013
I thought things
were good between us.

370
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,266
I thought we were
in a good place.

371
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,935
Obviously, I was... wrong.

372
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:08,419
And what about
the second time?

373
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,805
She seemed a little
distant of late.

374
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,024
A little depressed.
Do you know why?

375
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,609
Something to do
with that woman

376
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,028
who got pushed in front
of the subway car.

377
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,197
The one she talked
about in the video.

378
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,866
Rebecca also mentioned
something about a trunk that

379
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:23,568
went missing.
It didn't go missing; Callie took it.

380
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,603
I don't know how many times
Rebecca has to hear it

381
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,539
until she believes it.

382
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,458
I just wish I could make her
understand that I want Callie back, too.

383
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,961
Not because I think our
marriage can be saved--

384
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:34,913
I know that...
ship has sailed--

385
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,382
but... because I'm
worried about her.

386
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:40,385
I want to tell her
that it's okay,

387
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:42,337
that I want her to be happy.

388
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,925
Even if being happy means...
being with somebody else.

389
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,893
(phone auto-dials, line rings)

390
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:51,680
HOLMES: Watson?
Remember how you said yesterday

391
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,316
you thought Callie Burrell
was probably okay?

392
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:57,152
I do.
I'm pretty sure that's not right.

393
00:14:57,154 --> 00:15:00,355
I'm pretty sure
her husband killed her.

394
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:09,487
DREW (recorded): ...but because
I'm worried about her.

395
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:11,506
I want to tell that
it's okay,

396
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,458
that I want her to be happy.

397
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,993
Even if being happy means...

398
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:17,962
being with somebody else.

399
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:20,165
That was recorded
by the police the first time

400
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,933
they interviewed
Drew Gardner five months ago.

401
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:24,519
He said the same exact
thing to me this morning.

402
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:25,705
Verbatim.

403
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,656
And because he
repeated himself,

404
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,506
you think he's
a murderer.

405
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:30,475
No, it's not because
he repeated himself,

406
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,427
it's just that what he said
sounded rehearsed-- like...

407
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:35,346
like he came up with his story
and then stuck with it.

408
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,527
Perhaps it's lodged
in his brain because he's

409
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:38,350
had to repeat it so often.

410
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:40,268
To his sister-in-law,
to the police,

411
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,153
to his friends,
to his colleagues, to you.

412
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,522
I'm not poking holes;
you may very well be right.

413
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:47,191
I just want to be certain that
you've thought this through.

414
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:48,743
There's just something
about this guy,

415
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,328
something I didn't like.

416
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,830
Let's say your assessment
of the man is correct.

417
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,700
He is a cad and a killer--
that would mean the stakes

418
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,418
of this investigation
have just been raised.

419
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,203
Would you like me to tag in?

420
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,872
No.

421
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:02,740
No, not yet.

422
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,550
If you <i>were</i>
working this case,

423
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:15,252
what would your next step be?

424
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:19,941
Do you have
Mr. Gardner's cell number handy?

425
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,426
Gaslighting.

426
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,729
A form of psychological abuse

427
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:26,981
in which false information
is presented

428
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:30,285
with the intention
of disorienting a victim...

429
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:34,271
and/or steering them
on a certain course of action.

430
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:38,409
The name derives from
the 1938 stage play <i>Gaslight,</i>

431
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,777
also known as

432
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,913
<i>Angel Street.</i>
Why do you have

433
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:43,965
so many phones?
Well, why do you have only one?

434
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:46,117
These are burners.

435
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:49,554
They are utterly discardable,
virtually untraceable.

436
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:52,140
Uh, what are you doing?

437
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:54,458
I know...

438
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,961
that you killed her.

439
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:59,013
I know...

440
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,232
what you did with her body.

441
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,051
(beep)

442
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:07,138
Mr. Gardner's gas
has just been lit.

443
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,656
Now it's just a question
of surveilling him,

444
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,074
observing where he goes,
what he does.

445
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,609
You'll need to rent
a car for that.

446
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:13,161
If Gardner is a murderer,

447
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,279
our message may
throw him off his game.

448
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,782
He may reveal something to you
which he otherwise would have not.

449
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:19,117
Where are you going?

450
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,202
Police station to
question a suspect.

451
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:24,822
You're not the only one who's made
progress on their investigation.

452
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,926
Yeah, I recognize her.

453
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,995
She was in the news
a few months ago.

454
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:33,297
She got pushed in front
of a train or something.

455
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,299
Yeah.

456
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,336
But that's not...

457
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:42,857
how <i>you</i> know her, though,
is it, Mr. Samuels?

458
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,508
I mean, you...

459
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,944
you worked in the same
office building together.

460
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:48,479
Before she died.

461
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:52,066
She was a secretary;
you were a custodial engineer.

462
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:54,402
(sighing):
That's right.

463
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:57,538
We used to see each other
around the building sometimes.

464
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,207
Yeah. Yeah.

465
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,709
Do you remember seeing her
around the subway platform?

466
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:05,663
I arrived at a theory
last night.

467
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:07,465
The man who killed Ms. Tully,

468
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,667
he'd been
on that platform before.

469
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,219
He'd studied it.

470
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,921
He knew where
the security cameras were. Hm?

471
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:17,725
So I began to look at footage
from the days and weeks

472
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,011
preceding her murder.

473
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,647
You'll never guess who
I saw following her...

474
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:25,549
on more than one occasion.

475
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:32,223
Now, this was recorded

476
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:35,243
ten days before her murder.

477
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,528
There's Ms. Tully.

478
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,235
There's you.

479
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:45,728
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

480
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,706
that's a cell phone
that you're carrying?

481
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,424
You're being discreet,

482
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:52,743
but you are recording her.

483
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,379
You have a record,
Mr. Samuels?

484
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:59,517
You were arrested
on a stalking charge

485
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,436
in Florida in 2009.

486
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,271
That was a misunderstanding.

487
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:06,057
Was this a misunderstanding, too?
What are you,

488
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,892
six feet, about 185?

489
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:10,194
So was this guy.

490
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,113
Put a fake beard on you,
some sunglasses,

491
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:13,815
be hard to tell
the difference.

492
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:14,774
What do you think?

493
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,374
I think you make
an excellent point.

494
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,435
I would never have hurt Vivian.

495
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:19,954
Course you wouldn't.
Nor would you have

496
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:21,789
stalked her,
nor would you record images

497
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,941
of her on your phone.

498
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:27,111
All right, fine.

499
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:29,613
You're right,
I was there that night.

500
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:31,782
And I was in disguise.

501
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,718
But I didn't kill her.

502
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,419
I thought
she'd seen me

503
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,755
following her
a few nights before.

504
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:40,224
<i>So I started wearing a hat</i>
<i>and a scarf</i>

505
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:42,626
that covered my mouth.

506
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,562
I'm there.

507
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:47,265
I just,
I'm not in frame.

508
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:49,317
Well, that's convenient.

509
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,068
You don't get it.
I was recording her

510
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,987
that night, too.
I can prove that

511
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,822
I wasn't the one
that pushed her.

512
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,661
(Tully screams)
SAMUELS: Oh, my God, no!

513
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:03,598
(door opens, closes)
GREGSON: So, what do you think?

514
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,284
It's Anson Samuels' voice,
that much is certain.

515
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:09,504
The question is, has the video been
manipulated in some way.

516
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,789
If it hasn't,
did Samuels orchestrate

517
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,090
the pushing.

518
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,176
Did he hire an equally
mad associate

519
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:17,261
to murder the object
of his obsession

520
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,680
so that he could record
it for posterity?

521
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:21,599
Well, we're holding on to him
either way, but eventually,

522
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,500
we're gonna have to charge him
or cut him loose.

523
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:25,770
I was hoping that this new angle
would shed some light

524
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:27,271
on the identity
of the pusher, but...

525
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:28,806
as luck would have it,

526
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,192
his face isn't seen
by this camera, either.

527
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:33,561
Nor was the patch
on his jacket.

528
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:35,646
(phone ringing)
Patch?

529
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,201
Excuse me.

530
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,322
Watson. Still surveilling?

531
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:46,791
If by "surveilling,"
you mean sitting on my butt

532
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:50,378
watching a man do absolutely
nothing out of the ordinary,

533
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,046
it's going great.

534
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,998
The text I sent had no effect.

535
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,500
Drew Gardner has not left
the gallery all day.

536
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:57,919
Well, patience, Watson.

537
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:00,087
There is <i>no</i> branch
of detective work

538
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:02,340
which is as important
nor as neglected

539
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:04,559
as the art of tracing footsteps.

540
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:07,478
It's okay, I've still got
a few good hours left.

541
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Actually... you're not--
at least you're not good

542
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:12,549
between the hours of 8:00
and approximately 10:00 p.m.

543
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,088
What are you talking about?

544
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:17,342
I overheard you making plans
with a friend last night. Em.

545
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,407
Short for "Emily,"
if my memory serves.

546
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,859
Oh, no, I can't believe
I forgot again.

547
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:24,662
Well, I did not,
so I reached out to Alfredo

548
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:27,615
earlier on, and he is
standing by to relieve you.

549
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:28,899
Are you serious?

550
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,751
Thank you.

551
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,012
The busker.

552
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:42,046
Excuse me?

553
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,181
The busker.
The fiddler.

554
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,384
He's playing Paganini's,
uh, <i>24 Caprices,</i>

555
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:49,103
<i>Opus 1, Number 11.</i>

556
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:51,639
Rewind it.

557
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,774
There.

558
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,343
I don't hear anything

559
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:57,278
over the subway.
Yeah, neither do I.

560
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,897
Then how can you tell he's
playing Paganini's whatever?

561
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:02,733
I can see it-- I know
the piece from... the bowing,

562
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:05,036
fingering,
double-stop trills.

563
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:07,038
You don't know
I play the violin?

564
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,240
Before today I didn't
even know you ate food.

565
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:10,908
I don't get it
. does it matter

566
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,710
what song the guy's playing?

567
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:15,379
Oh, it doesn't. What matters is,
he stops in the middle.

568
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,614
Watch.

569
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,200
He stops halfway
through the andante,

570
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:20,735
doesn't even touch the presto.

571
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:22,270
Question is: why?

572
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:25,139
Why does he stop so suddenly
and leave the platform?

573
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:27,558
The answer is...

574
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,312
he sees our pusher.

575
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:37,418
He knows him.

576
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,770
He might even have known
what he was about to do.

577
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:46,143
We find our busker...
we find the pusher.

578
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:47,778
Hey.

579
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,414
Hey, I didn't know you guys
were gonna be here, too.

580
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,750
It was sort of a last second thing.
Hey.

581
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:54,818
How is everything?
What's going on?

582
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,005
There's a reason why I asked
Hope and Ken to join us.

583
00:22:58,007 --> 00:22:59,707
Uh, can I get a beer?

584
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:02,215
Uh, your mother called me
the other day.

585
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,827
Yeah?

586
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:04,679
We got to talking.
Thanks.

587
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,964
I told her how you and I
kept missing each other.

588
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:09,800
She said you're working
as some sort of detective now.

589
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:13,670
And she's
so proud of you, excited.

590
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,474
But when I heard, I just...

591
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,810
What?

592
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,946
I don't know. I...

593
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:24,615
Well, in a way, on the one hand,
it explained a lot.

594
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:26,734
You know, the way
you've fallen out of touch

595
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:28,202
these last few months?

596
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:30,871
How you've made and broken
so many plans with me.

597
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:32,540
With Hope and Ken.

598
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,125
With others.

599
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:36,711
We were worried about you, Joan.
I guess we still are.

600
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:40,297
(laughs)

601
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,501
Is this is an intervention?

602
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:45,136
Wow. No, it's not.

603
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:47,704
It's just a few friends
expressing concern

604
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:49,507
for another.

605
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:51,092
That's an intervention.
Trust me.

606
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:53,477
I have helped organize
plenty of them.

607
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,846
Back when you were still
a sober companion, right?

608
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,515
After you were a surgeon,

609
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,383
but before you decided
to become a private eye?

610
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:03,053
I'm sorry,
but you seem lost.

611
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:06,723
You have ever since
you stopped practicing medicine.

612
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:11,228
We know that your new mentor
is your last sober client.

613
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,580
And...?

614
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:15,065
"And...?"

615
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:18,669
Joan, you quit your job
and moved out of your apartment

616
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:21,539
so you could live full-time
with a recovering drug addict

617
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,542
who's going to teach you how
to be some sort of gumshoe?

618
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:26,510
Are you involved with him?

619
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,130
Because that would
explain a lot.

620
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:32,583
You know what?

621
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:35,019
I am gonna see you guys later.

622
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:36,887
What? Joan!

623
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:38,439
I didn't think that I would have

624
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:40,757
to explain my life to you, Emily.
Come on.

625
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,444
I mean, what would you say to me
if I told you

626
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:45,095
I was quitting
journalism to become a...

627
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,480
I don't know-- a windsurfer?

628
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:48,399
(phone chimes)
Or if Hope told you

629
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,618
she was giving up teaching
to join the Marines.

630
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,903
Would you really just
congratulate us?

631
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:56,290
Or would you pull us aside and
make sure everything was okay?

632
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,793
So, do you think what I do
is like windsurfing?

633
00:24:58,795 --> 00:24:59,960
I don't know what it's like.

634
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:01,212
I just know you.

635
00:25:01,214 --> 00:25:04,298
And I know
you're not a detective.

636
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,396
One of those
self-storage places.

637
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:22,483
The guy you wanted me to watch
talked to the manager,

638
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,468
walked in that
unit right there.

639
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:33,327
That trunk.

640
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:35,746
<i>It belonged</i>
<i>to his sister-in-law.</i>

641
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:37,814
<i>She thought he might he</i>
<i>used it to get rid of his wife.</i>

642
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:39,850
Hold up. Are you trying to tell
me there's a person in there?

643
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,652
Sherlock sent him
an anonymous text this morning,

644
00:25:41,654 --> 00:25:45,155
said he knew where the body was.

645
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:00,337
We need to call the cops.
No, no, not yet.

646
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:01,722
What do you mean "not yet".
I want to do this myself.

647
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:03,173
Do you still have that slim Jim?
Yeah.

648
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,309
Look, I didn't hear
a alarm trip on,

649
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,645
so all I have to do is get past
that door lock.

650
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:08,779
Joan...
What?

651
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:09,763
You don't think
I can do this?

652
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:10,948
Oh, I know you can do this,

653
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,366
'cause after
everything I taught,

654
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:14,128
you could jack that car
in your sleep-- Joan!

655
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:48,903
MAN:
Hey!

656
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,437
That's enough, ma'am.

657
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,939
Step away from
the car, please.

658
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:53,524
Hey, is there a problem?

659
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:55,559
Is this your vehicle, sir?
Yeah.

660
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,945
I'm the guard here.
I saw this woman

661
00:26:57,947 --> 00:27:00,164
breaking into your car
in one of my monitors.

662
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,899
You-- You're the one who came to
ask me questions about Callie.

663
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:04,568
I'm investigating this man.

664
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,954
I have reason to believe
that he murdered his wife

665
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:08,622
and hid her body in this trunk.

666
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:10,174
What?! That's a lie.

667
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,425
There's an easy way
to see if I'm right.

668
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:12,876
Just ask him to open it.

669
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:14,578
Excuse me? I don't have
to open a damn thing.

670
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,930
His name is Drew Gardner.

671
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:17,765
You can look it up on
your phone.

672
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:19,850
There are articles on
the disappearance of his wife.

673
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:22,136
She went missing six months ago,
same time as this trunk.

674
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:24,921
(sirens approaching) Would you open up
this trunk, please?

675
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:26,757
Are you kidding me?!

676
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,360
If she's wrong, you ain't
got nothing to hide.

677
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:31,695
You can either open
up that trunk for me,

678
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,447
or open it up
for them.

679
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:49,780
Happy now?

680
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:00,184
(lock buzzes,
door creaks open)

681
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:02,787
(door slams shut)

682
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:15,583
I have the very strongest
sensation of déjà vu.

683
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:19,754
I paid your bail.

684
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:21,472
Paperwork's being processed.

685
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:25,793
You'll be released back
into society shortly.

686
00:28:25,795 --> 00:28:28,146
Thank you.

687
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:30,297
I spoke with Alfredo
before I came here.

688
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,350
He told me what
transpired tonight.

689
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,802
You took a chance. Yeah?

690
00:28:34,804 --> 00:28:36,804
Fortune often favors the bold.

691
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:38,523
But not tonight.
Mm.

692
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,608
You were right.

693
00:28:41,743 --> 00:28:43,477
The trunk was the same one

694
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,947
that Rebecca Burrell mentioned
to us the other day.

695
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:47,782
If Drew Gardner
wasn't using that

696
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:49,584
to get rid of his wife's body,
what was he doing with it?

697
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:52,370
Well, I didn't speak
to the man himself,

698
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,589
but I did speak to the officers
who arrested you.

699
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,324
According to the statement
that he gave them,

700
00:28:57,326 --> 00:28:59,159
he sold the trunk

701
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:02,046
shortly after he received
the video from his wife.

702
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:03,631
Partly out of spite,

703
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,850
partly because
his gallery was struggling.

704
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,885
He knew it was worth
several thousand dollars.

705
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:09,887
Sold it to a client.

706
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:12,190
He could have told Rebecca
that months ago.

707
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:14,058
Mm. Well, he was afraid.

708
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,693
He knew
what he'd done was wrong.

709
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:17,728
The trunk was not his to sell.

710
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,948
Apparently, your visit yesterday
inspired him

711
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,617
to come clean.

712
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,569
The idea that
Rebecca thought

713
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:27,071
he'd used the trunk
to dispose of Callie

714
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:29,290
was more troubling
to him than the idea

715
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:32,026
of being punished for
his actual transgression.

716
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:34,245
So he reached out
to the guy he sold it to

717
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:35,863
and made an offer
to buy it back.

718
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:37,915
The storage space
that he accessed tonight

719
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,750
was the collector's, not his.

720
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:42,570
He was merely
picking up the trunk

721
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,338
so he could return
it to Rebecca.

722
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,007
Apparently,
there is a paper trail

723
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:49,043
which confirms
this series of events.

724
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:51,545
I was so sure
she was in that trunk.

725
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:55,766
Given the many givens,
your hypothesis was good.

726
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:57,935
But I was wrong.

727
00:29:57,937 --> 00:29:59,553
You were wrong about a trunk.

728
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,572
That does not mean
that you were wrong

729
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:02,940
about the man being a murderer.

730
00:30:02,942 --> 00:30:05,610
I just keep thinking

731
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:08,496
that if you were the one
to break into that car,

732
00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:10,564
she would have been there.

733
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:12,783
But because it was me...
(sighs)

734
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:16,070
I have another errand to run
before tonight is through.

735
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,588
In the morning,

736
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,758
I propose that we begin
working both cases together.

737
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,744
After you've helped me
find my subway pusher,

738
00:30:23,746 --> 00:30:27,682
perhaps I can help you find
Callie Burrell.

739
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:32,470
(playing a lively
classical melody)

740
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:38,526
Bach? Why, Thaddeus,
you've gone commercial.

741
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:39,860
How do you know my name?

742
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:41,228
Your many citations

743
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,263
for performing
on subway platforms.

744
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:44,949
I'm assuming
those are the reasons

745
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,701
you're now performing
above ground.

746
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:48,452
Oh, you're the cops.

747
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:51,072
No, no, he is.
I'm a concerned citizen.

748
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:53,491
Name Vivian Tully
mean anything to you?

749
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:54,709
No.

750
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,911
Well, maybe her
picture will.

751
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:03,334
No.
HOLMES: You were there the night

752
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:05,219
a madman pushed her in
front of a subway train.

753
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,637
There's no use
in denying it.

754
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,806
We've got you on video.

755
00:31:08,808 --> 00:31:10,975
Yeah, okay, I was there.

756
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:13,293
But I only heard about
what happened on the news.

757
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:15,062
I wasn't there
when it actually went down.

758
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:17,648
Of course you were, 'cause
the minute you saw the pusher,

759
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,567
you picked up your stuff,
and you left.

760
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,019
Why? 'Cause you know him.
I'd like to know how.

761
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:24,471
Sorry, man, I don't know
what you're talking about.

762
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:25,906
You do know what
I'm talking about,

763
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:27,241
and the sooner you
tell me the connection,

764
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,859
the less likely
I'll be to tell

765
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:30,745
Detective Bell here that
you're also a pickpocket.

766
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:31,996
<i>I was studying you</i>
<i>from across the street.</i>

767
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:33,664
<i>You're actually very good.</i>

768
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:37,168
<i>Fiddling must keep</i>
<i>those fingers nimble, hmm?</i>

769
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,838
Detective, would you give us
a moment, please?

770
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:47,345
Look, I didn't know
the guy, okay?

771
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:48,829
I just knew his face.

772
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:50,931
I'd seen him on the platform
a few nights before,

773
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:53,050
tried to lift his wallet,
he caught me.

774
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:55,720
Grabbed my wrist, I panicked,
hauled off and punched him.

775
00:31:55,722 --> 00:31:57,054
He fell, I took off.

776
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:59,390
When I saw him the night
he killed the girl,

777
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:01,341
I was just worried
he might recognize me

778
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:03,394
and call the transit cops,
so I left.

779
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:08,649
You're checking out my
coat right now, aren't you?

780
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:10,534
Thinking of where you
can infiltrate it.

781
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:12,203
Sorry, okay?
It's a force of habit.

782
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:13,871
Ah, of course.

783
00:32:13,873 --> 00:32:15,990
I mean, a coat to a
picker of pockets

784
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:18,192
is like a vault to a
safecracker, isn't it?

785
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:19,543
You've got to study it,

786
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:21,545
find a way in without
being detected.

787
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:24,331
So... the pusher.

788
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:28,669
He had a patch on his
jacket right here.

789
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:31,555
Perhaps you'd be able
to tell me what it was.

790
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,062
If you feel like
you have to, don't.

791
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:39,713
So your busker was able

792
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:42,316
to pick out this patch
from an image search. Now what?

793
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:44,235
We bring it
to the public's attention,

794
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,053
see if it,
in conjunction with the sketch,

795
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:47,054
shakes anything loose.

796
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:48,239
(door opens)

797
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:52,059
I thought you both should know:

798
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:55,913
I invited Drew Gardner to
the station a little while ago.

799
00:32:57,032 --> 00:32:59,033
If you apologize,

800
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:00,951
promise to pay for the damage

801
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:02,569
you did to his car,

802
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:05,339
and refrain
from any further harassment,

803
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:08,209
he'll drop the charges
against you.

804
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:10,127
I wouldn't accept Mr. Gardner's
terms under any circumstances.

805
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:12,579
Yeah, well, she's not you.

806
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:13,931
Miss Watson's instincts
have been telling her

807
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:15,349
that the man is a murderer.

808
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:18,418
He's right. I'm not like you.
I'm not like you.

809
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,521
I... (sighs)

810
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:22,606
I've never had a record before.

811
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,976
Well...

812
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:28,312
Me and Mr. Gardner

813
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,531
will be in my office.

814
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:33,767
Think about what you're saying.

815
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:35,035
I am. I have.

816
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:36,370
Last night was a wake-up call.

817
00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:37,404
You made a mistake.

818
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:38,456
No, it wasn't just what happened

819
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,907
at the storage facility.

820
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:41,625
My friends found out
what I've been doing.

821
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:42,993
I didn't realize you'd been
keeping it a secret.

822
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:44,044
They don't get it.

823
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:45,496
Opinions are like anine, Watson.

824
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:46,797
Everyone has one.

825
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,998
You know what, maybe what you do

826
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,467
is not something
that you can teach.

827
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:50,634
Maybe it's something

828
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,336
that just has
to come naturally.

829
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:54,672
I-I just... I have a lot to
think about, that's all.

830
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:10,604
(doorbell rings)

831
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:15,025
Ms. Burrell? Joan Watson.

832
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:16,660
We met the other day.

833
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:18,028
Please.

834
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,313
Have a seat.

835
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:20,498
Thank you.

836
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,832
Did you want to ask me

837
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:23,334
more questions
about Callie?

838
00:34:23,336 --> 00:34:26,820
Actually, I came
to apologize.

839
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:28,606
I got a little too aggressive

840
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,625
with the investigation
last night, and...

841
00:34:31,627 --> 00:34:34,494
I'm afraid that Mr. Holmes
and I will not be able

842
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:36,680
to remain on the case.

843
00:34:48,193 --> 00:34:49,944
Ms. Watson?

844
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:51,729
Callie's jacket-- that patch.

845
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:54,532
You mean Drew's jacket.

846
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:55,733
It was cold that day.

847
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:56,984
He let her wear it.

848
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:59,019
She called it
his "hippie coat.

849
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,521
He got it at a concert
in college or something.

850
00:35:01,523 --> 00:35:03,190
This is gonna sound strange,

851
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:05,376
but has Drew ever had a beard?

852
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:07,494
Yeah, for a while.

853
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:09,330
He shaved it off
around the same time

854
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:10,965
that Callie disappeared.

855
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:14,001
Why?

856
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,202
Let's start with what
we know, shall we?

857
00:35:25,204 --> 00:35:26,670
Vivian Tully was murdered

858
00:35:26,672 --> 00:35:29,506
six months ago
by a bearded individual.

859
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:31,909
We know that
Drew Gardner wore a beard

860
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,277
at approximately
that time.

861
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:35,078
He also owned a jacket

862
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,915
identical to the one
worn by the killer.

863
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:39,349
Several days later,

864
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:41,268
Callie Burrell
records a video

865
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,554
in which she says
the murder has affected her,

866
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:45,255
it's made her think.

867
00:35:45,257 --> 00:35:47,224
She leaves Drew.

868
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:49,693
Thanks to you, we now have
reason to believe

869
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:51,645
that Drew Gardner
was the man

870
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:52,896
that pushed Vivian Tully

871
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,781
in front of
the subway train.

872
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:57,234
Question is, why?

873
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:59,653
What are the odds that it would

874
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:03,373
affect his wife so much
that she leaves him?

875
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,375
Is it possible that's
what he was counting on?

876
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:07,294
If he was, what kind
of plan is that?

877
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,946
I mean, how could he know
that killing Vivian Tully

878
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:12,115
would affect Callie
the way that it did?

879
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:14,218
I don't know.

880
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,003
Maybe I'm wrong
about this, too.

881
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:17,254
Maybe it's just
a coincidence

882
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:18,622
that he has that
jacket with a patch.

883
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:19,789
Have I... have I told you

884
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:20,790
how distracting
I find self-doubt?

885
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,142
If you must wallow,

886
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,011
I ask that you do it
in the privacy of your room.

887
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:25,429
Do I need to remind you
that I made

888
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,097
a mistake last night
that got me arrested?

889
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:28,065
Do I need to remind you

890
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:29,066
that you made
a discovery today

891
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:30,634
that may ultimately
solve both cases?

892
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:33,570
Do you wish to mourn the former
or celebrate the latter?

893
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:35,439
'Cause I, for one,
am fully engaged.

894
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,308
I want to solve this.

895
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,643
Oh!

896
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:40,994
Two events.

897
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,830
One murder by subway train,
one disappearance.

898
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:47,167
Event "A" cannot
reasonably be said

899
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:50,003
to have any effect
on Event "B."

900
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:51,955
Yet it defies reason

901
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:53,590
to think that the two
are not connected.

902
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:56,126
We know Vivian Tully is dead.

903
00:36:56,128 --> 00:36:59,329
We strongly suspect
Callie Burrell is dead.

904
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:01,164
Drew Gardner, he has
no discernible link

905
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,933
to Vivian Tully,
and therefore,

906
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:05,302
no discernible motive
for her murder.

907
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:07,938
He does, meanwhile,
have motive for his wife's murder.

908
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,106
The marriage
was in trouble;

909
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:10,490
she had left him
once before.

910
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:11,942
The question remains:

911
00:37:11,944 --> 00:37:13,860
What are the odds
that the murder

912
00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:16,697
we think he is responsible for
on the subway platform

913
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:18,532
would compel his wife to leave

914
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,450
the marriage for a second time?

915
00:37:20,452 --> 00:37:21,735
How, in this case,

916
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:24,871
does "A" lead to "B"?

917
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:28,408
Maybe "A" didn't lead to "B."

918
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:31,912
Maybe "B" led to "A".

919
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:36,166
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you people:

920
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:37,217
I didn't kill Callie.

921
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:38,735
Well, as a
matter of fact,

922
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:40,420
that's only one
of the murders

923
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:41,722
that we're
accusing you of.

924
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:43,173
This is the other.

925
00:37:45,643 --> 00:37:49,396
This is the woman Callie
talked about in her video.

926
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:53,016
You think I had
something to do with this?

927
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:54,884
Six months ago, you had a beard

928
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:56,820
like the one in that sketch.

929
00:37:56,822 --> 00:37:59,406
You also owned
an army jacket

930
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:02,242
with a distinctive
patch on the right arm.

931
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:05,696
I gave that jacket
to Goodwill a long time ago.

932
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:07,648
Did you give them
your beard as well?

933
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,617
Or did you shave it off,
so you would look

934
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,753
less like the man
who murdered Vivian Tully?

935
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:15,422
Last night,
when Ms. Watson

936
00:38:15,424 --> 00:38:18,091
suggested you that you
might also be the pusher,

937
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:19,843
I was confused.

938
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:21,545
And that doesn't
happen very often.

939
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:23,013
But in my defense,

940
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:25,716
the sequence of events,
as I understood them,

941
00:38:25,718 --> 00:38:28,018
just didn't make any sense.

942
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,469
You choose a woman at random

943
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:33,190
and you shove her to her death.

944
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:34,558
Several days later,

945
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,594
the crime inspires your wife
to leave you.

946
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:39,946
Now, the odds that the first

947
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:42,783
leads to the second--
astronomical.

948
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:44,901
Then Ms. Watson recalled

949
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:47,103
that your wife
had left you once before.

950
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:48,205
The video.

951
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:50,207
You claimed that
Callie left it for you

952
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:51,941
six months ago,
but that was a lie.

953
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:54,244
She made it for you
a year and a half ago...

954
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:57,130
the first time
she left you.

955
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:58,615
That's ridiculous.

956
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:00,317
WATSON: Pretend for a second
that I'm right.

957
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:02,502
The video is 18 months old.

958
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:03,887
In it, Callie
references a woman

959
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:05,589
that was pushed
in front of a train.

960
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:07,207
"The woman
with the flowers,"

961
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:08,975
to use her exact words.

962
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:10,594
That would mean 18 months ago

963
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:12,896
another woman was pushed
in front of a train.

964
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,798
Another woman holding flowers.

965
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,817
Her name was Anna Peters.

966
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:18,902
She was standing
on a platform

967
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:20,771
in Harlem when two teenagers
on their way to school

968
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:21,888
got into a shoving match.

969
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,139
One of them bumped her

970
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,408
over the edge by accident.

971
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,776
It was a big story.

972
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,310
A lot of the media outlets
that covered it

973
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:29,279
mentioned that Anna was
on her way to the hospital

974
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,814
to visit a sick friend.

975
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,582
WATSON: When she fell, she
was holding flowers

976
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:34,418
that she had picked
from her own garden.

977
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,319
Flowers that
she was planning

978
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:37,954
to give to her friend.
HOLMES: Hmm.

979
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,790
That's interesting, isn't it?

980
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:42,459
The man who murdered
Vivian Tully six months ago

981
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:45,762
inexplicably gave her
a bouquet of flowers

982
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:47,597
right before he pushed her.

983
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,666
You gave her those flowers.

984
00:39:49,668 --> 00:39:51,385
Why?

985
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:53,804
You thought you had
figured out a way

986
00:39:53,806 --> 00:39:56,106
to kill your wife
and get away with it.

987
00:39:56,108 --> 00:39:58,108
You'd use the video
that she sent you

988
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,610
the first time she left you
to explain her disappearance.

989
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:01,862
All you needed now

990
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:03,647
<i>was a subway pushing</i>
<i>in the present</i>

991
00:40:03,649 --> 00:40:05,198
<i>so that the video</i>
<i>would make sense.</i>

992
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,518
A pushing involving a
woman holding flowers.

993
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,737
(chuckles)

994
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,622
This is insane.

995
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:15,525
You're just some woman
with a crazy story.

996
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,411
You want me to be guilty,

997
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:19,129
so you've constructed
this elaborate fiction

998
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:20,831
to accommodate your theory.

999
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,282
So, you're sticking
to your story, then?

1000
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:23,283
On the record, you're saying

1001
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:24,334
that you received that video

1002
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:25,552
from your wife six months ago?

1003
00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:27,554
I am repeating that
on the record.

1004
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,489
Well, we rather hoped
that you would.

1005
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:31,475
We were granted access

1006
00:40:31,477 --> 00:40:33,643
to Callie's e-mails
this morning.

1007
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:35,512
Obviously, you also had
access to those e-mails,

1008
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,898
because you needed to prove
to anyone who might ask

1009
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,683
that the video
came from her.

1010
00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:42,602
GREGSON: You deleted the original
e-mail from her account--

1011
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:45,188
the one she sent
a year and a half ago.

1012
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,191
You then re-sent it
when the time was right.

1013
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:49,726
The thing is...

1014
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:53,196
we found it archived and
stored in the server.

1015
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:54,781
WATSON:
We know and can prove,

1016
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:57,617
that you received that
e-mail 18 months ago,

1017
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:00,704
a few days after Anna
Peters was murdered.

1018
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:03,623
But... don't take
my word for it.

1019
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:06,075
I'm just a woman
with a crazy story.

1020
00:41:17,872 --> 00:41:20,056
(ringtone plays)

1021
00:41:25,112 --> 00:41:26,596
Hey.

1022
00:41:26,598 --> 00:41:27,931
You picked up.

1023
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:29,699
I'm glad.
I wasn't sure you would.

1024
00:41:29,701 --> 00:41:31,785
I wasn't sure I would, either.

1025
00:41:31,787 --> 00:41:33,703
About the other night.

1026
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:35,605
You were out of line?

1027
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:38,208
I'm not gonna apologize
for worrying about you.

1028
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,376
Listen, Em...

1029
00:41:39,378 --> 00:41:40,777
I am, however,
going to apologize

1030
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:42,245
for doubting you.

1031
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:45,665
My editor just assigned me
the craziest story.

1032
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:48,284
"Man Pushes Woman
In Front of Train

1033
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:50,119
to Cover Up Murder of Wife."

1034
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,721
Sound familiar?

1035
00:41:51,723 --> 00:41:52,756
(knocking insistently)
SHERLOCK: Watson?

1036
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:54,791
Oh, hold on a second.

1037
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:56,960
Oh, uh...

1038
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:58,728
when you're finished,

1039
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,232
if you could, uh, join me
downstairs to peruse some files?

1040
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:04,234
An old colleague
of mine in London

1041
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:05,819
asked for my thoughts
on a homicide investigation.

1042
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:07,821
I was able to identify
the murderer

1043
00:42:07,823 --> 00:42:09,222
in a matter of seconds.

1044
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:10,407
I would like to see

1045
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:13,410
how long it takes you.

1046
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:15,362
You enjoyed a modicum
of success today, Watson.

1047
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:18,198
Let's not let it go
our heads, now, shall we?

1048
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:22,502
Hey, uh, Emily,

1049
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:23,954
something just came up
work-related.

1050
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:26,823
Another time?

1051
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:28,675
Yeah, another time, okay?

1052
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:30,377
Bye.

1053
