1
00:00:02,257 --> 00:00:03,849
Previously, on Elementary...

2
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:06,434
He is, without question,
the most sinister taker of lives

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,847
I have ever had the displeasure
of pursuing.

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,016
I have no intention
of capturing M.

5
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:13,438
I have every intention

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,106
of torturing and murdering him.

7
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,559
You-you don't mind
if I call you M?

8
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:19,477
Sebastian Moran--
that's my real name.

9
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,946
He sends me coded message
on me cell phone.

10
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,648
You can kill me
for all the others,

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,866
but your girl,

12
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:26,117
that was him.

13
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,570
That was Moriarty.

14
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:35,743
Uh, don't forget to remind me

15
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,629
to call a meeting
of the Endowment Committee.

16
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:39,831
Thanks, Beverly.

17
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,940
But you don't have
to call for help.

18
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:07,859
You aren't having
a heart attack.

19
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,110
Who the hell are you?

20
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,830
Just someone who's
been studying you.

21
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:13,883
You've been dependent
on a pacemaker for the

22
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,889
past seven years.

23
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:22,774
I'm doing that to you.

24
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:24,709
Watch.

25
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,961
See?

26
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:29,047
Every pacemaker

27
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,432
has its own unique
identifying number.

28
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:33,384
If you've got that,

29
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,720
you can make
that little box in your chest

30
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,255
do all sorts of things--

31
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,723
things like send

32
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,575
several hundred volts
through your body

33
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:42,593
with just the push of a button.

34
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:43,945
Wait! Stop!

35
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:46,281
What do you want?

36
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:49,817
Nothing, really;
I'm happy just to watch you die.

37
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,770
It would look like a
heart attack, you know.

38
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:55,123
But, then...

39
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:59,460
I'm not representing
my own interest tonight.

40
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:01,462
Cast your ballot.

41
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:03,748
My ballot?

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,950
That's what this is all about?

43
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,888
Vote to revoke,
and I'll be on my way.

44
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,923
All right.

45
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,307
There.

46
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:33,978
Thank you.

47
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,021
Turn this crap over
to the football.

48
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:02,023
Yeah.

49
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:07,011
Not that match,
the Arsenal game.

50
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:10,315
Noted philanthropist
Phillip Van Der Hoff...

51
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,234
Quiet!

52
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:15,119
Go back to the news.

53
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:18,039
...Van Der Hoff's
wife was vacationing in Austria,

54
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,875
but is said to be
on her way home this morning.

55
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,495
Is everything okay?

56
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,530
Yeah. Fine.

57
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:28,216
It's good that you're
here, actually.

58
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:30,218
You kn...
you know how to...

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,970
reset a dislocated shoulder.

60
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:33,805
And you dislocated your
own shoulder because...?

61
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:36,090
Are you thick?
Am I thick? You are the one

62
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:37,375
stuck in a straitjacket.

63
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,543
Why are you...?
It had been too long.

64
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,148
Please.

65
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,216
Okay.

66
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:46,517
Ow...

67
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,052
Looks like an
anterior dislocation.

68
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:50,104
Yeah-- ow!

69
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:53,157
Actually, could you just...

70
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,158
wait a moment...

71
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,612
What was that?

72
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:00,248
I'm gonna get
you some ice.

73
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:03,868
Hi.

74
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,037
You okay?
Yes, I'm fine. How are you?

75
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,571
Listen, I just got a call

76
00:04:07,573 --> 00:04:09,757
from the warden at Newgate.

77
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,311
Sebastian Moran just got out
of a stint in solitary.

78
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,046
I don't know
if he had an epiphany

79
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,081
during all that downtime,
but he claims

80
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,717
there are more people
he was ordered to kill;

81
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,719
victims he never
told anyone about.

82
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,254
He wants to confess.

83
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:24,722
Well, bully for him.

84
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,057
On one condition:

85
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:29,143
the only person
he'll talk to is you.

86
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:33,114
How are you, Sherlock?

87
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,986
How are you?

88
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,077
Thanks, Will.

89
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,297
I've got something
new for you.

90
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:51,999
'Cause you and me,
we both want the same thing.

91
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,168
To get rid of him.

92
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:58,056
So it's to be another
tale of Moriarty.

93
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:00,091
Shh.

94
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,128
He's got ears and eyes
everywhere in here.

95
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,815
I want him because
he set me up to be caught by you...

96
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:11,319
and for the two mugs he sent
in here who tried to shiv me.

97
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,404
And you...

98
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:16,407
you want him 'cause
he killed your girl.

99
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,111
Mr. Moran, your claims
about Moriarty

100
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:23,647
cannot be substantiated
and are of no interest.

101
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:26,117
Now, I was told you
had some information

102
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,536
about some other
of your victims.

103
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:32,790
And I was told, every year
about Christmastime,

104
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,676
a fat, jolly old man
delivers toffees

105
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,345
to good little
girls and boys.

106
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:39,380
Now, I waited up
for him one night

107
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:42,350
to steal his stash...
but he didn't show.

108
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:48,740
Will... show Sherlock
the article.

109
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:53,344
He had me
cut this out.

110
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,902
That was no accident.

111
00:06:00,904 --> 00:06:03,154
That was ordered by him.

112
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:12,213
This man died of
a heart attack.

113
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:14,882
What makes you think there
was someone else involved?

114
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,668
Because before you
nicked me in Harlem,

115
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,805
I had a text with
that man's face on it...

116
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:23,057
and the order was:

117
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,676
"String him up
just like the others."

118
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,845
Now, you find out
who killed Van Der Hoff,

119
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:31,232
and you'll be
one step closer to him.

120
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:33,267
To Moriarty.

121
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,521
Will.

122
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:44,245
Oh.

123
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:46,164
And one more thing:

124
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,399
When they ask you
what happened here today,

125
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,251
keep it quiet.

126
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:52,036
What happened?

127
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:55,873
Get away from him!

128
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,511
Too late, boys.

129
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:02,413
No medic needed.

130
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:04,048

A Landmark Story
Original Air Date on May 2, 2013

137
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:25,186
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

138
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,410
The other guards say
he had his finger

139
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:30,445
to his lips while
they were dragging him off,

140
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,146
like he was telling you
to be quiet.

141
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:34,783
According to your statement,
he just issued

142
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:37,335
a bunch of threats,
called off the meeting,

143
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:38,453
then attacked
the guard, so...

144
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:40,021
what's to be quiet about?

145
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:43,158
I'm afraid I have no idea.

146
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,381
Hey. Let's talk.

147
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58,223
You have been training me
to ferret out lies.

148
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,025
When Captain Gregson
asked you

149
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,227
what Moran wanted you
to keep quiet about,

150
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:03,728
you hesitated.

151
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,914
That doesn't prove deceit--
it's a feint,

152
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,066
designed to sharpen
your deductive skills.

153
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:09,534
Okay, the last time
you like about Moran

154
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:10,986
you were planning
to torture and kill him.

155
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:12,571
I was quite honest
about my intentions.

156
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,789
Okay, what if these impulses
get triggered again?

157
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,024
You're not longer required

158
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,358
to play hall monitor
to my impulses.

159
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,001
Okay, but I am allowed
to be concerned.

160
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,228
Mm.

161
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,799
Just so you know, I intended
to share this with you,

162
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,801
just not here.

163
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:30,872
Moran told me that Moriarty
was behind that man's death;

164
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:33,692
that he himself was once
contracted to kill him.

165
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,093
Now, I understand your concern,

166
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,545
but this is not
history repeating itself.

167
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:39,681
Okay, then what's different?

168
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:41,433
You're getting ahead
of yourself, Watson.

169
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,818
Moran has proven himself to be
extremely unreliable.

170
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,988
I would like to make sure these
are not his paranoid ravings

171
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,774
before I involve Captain Gregson
or anyone else.

172
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:52,393
Fortunately, it should be
quite simple to find out

173
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:53,561
if there was anything
suspicious

174
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:54,996
about that man's death.

175
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:57,198
You have a copy
of his autopsy report?

176
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Phillip Van Der Hoff
was a middle-aged man

177
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:00,452
with a known heart condition.

178
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:02,070
There was no autopsy.

179
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,172
His body was released to the
mortuary this afternoon.

180
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:07,709
Flowers are to be sent to the
McTierney Brothers Funeral Home.

181
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,095
What, you want to send
a bouquet and a card?

182
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:11,346
"With deepest sympathy.

183
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:13,014
P.S.: This may
have been murder."

184
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:14,633
Not exactly.

185
00:09:14,635 --> 00:09:16,651
So you prove you're reasonable

186
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,087
by asking me to commit a felony.

187
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,939
Security in mortuaries
is so lax

188
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:23,975
you can hardly call it
breaking and entering.

189
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,813
Embalmed.

190
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,599
Embalmed.

191
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,819
You say that like you've broken
into funeral parlors before.

192
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:38,823
Well, there was a certain
problem of Thor Bridge...

193
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:43,745
Yes.

194
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,952
As I'd hoped,

195
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:53,755
not scheduled for embalming
until the morning.

196
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:55,957
Yep.

197
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,631
Well, he had a pacemaker.

198
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,734
And his heart condition
checks out.

199
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:08,269
Hm.

200
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,021
Yep.

201
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,659
No sign of any defensive wounds.

202
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,695
No skin under his fingernails.

203
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:18,980
Ah.

204
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,284
Hm.

205
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:25,587
He has four small
bruises on each palm.

206
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,488
He's clenched
his fists so tightly,

207
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,124
his fingers have left bruises.

208
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,375
I've heard about that in people

209
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:31,760
who have been struck
by lightning,

210
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:33,261
and electrocuted
on the third rail, but...

211
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:35,296
but it's not consistent
with a heart attack.

212
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:36,664
Agreed.

213
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,599
We'll have to proceed.

214
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:38,600
Seriously?

215
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:40,135
Mm.
But what happens

216
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:42,053
when people figure out
that somebody came in here

217
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,722
and cut up a body
in the middle of the night?

218
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:45,298
We'll sew him back up
again, won't we?

219
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:46,225
What?

220
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,610
Any luck, they'll assume that autopsy
was done at the hospital,

221
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:51,529
or they might just put it down
to a paperwork error, I don't know.

222
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,782
Anyway, they're certainly
not gonna assume

223
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:53,962
two people broke in
in the middle of the

224
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:56,511
night and performed an
illicit autopsy, are they?

225
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,870
Right, because
that would be crazy.

226
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:01,206
No.

227
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,992
No.

228
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,495
Fine.

229
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:09,547
No, no.

230
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:11,883
From the shoulder.

231
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:14,836
Hm?

232
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,889
Y-You need to
press harder.

233
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,057
All right.

234
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,643
Harder!
Mm.

235
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:23,511
You're using
the wrong...

236
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:25,546
Okay, just stop.

237
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:27,565
Stop.

238
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,554
Just give it to me.

239
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:44,449
Mm...

240
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,370
Mm...

241
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:50,905
Oh, that's lovely.

242
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:52,907
You really are
quite skilled, Watson.

243
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,575
No.

244
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:56,744
I am dissecting a body
in the middle of the night.

245
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:59,047
We are not having a moment.

246
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:09,357
Okay, well,
there's no broken ribs.

247
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:11,693
I mean, I really can't
see the heart from here.

248
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:13,895
I would need a saw
and a rib spreader,

249
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,563
which I'm guessing
you don't have.

250
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,984
Okay, let's, uh...

251
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:23,938
Oh, this is strange.

252
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,373
Look at this.

253
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,909
See how the blood
is coagulated

254
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,461
and the capillaries...

255
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:32,080
have bubbles
burnt into them.

256
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,983
Looks like his
blood boiled.

257
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:39,471
One has to admire the sheer
Promethean ingenuity.

258
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:41,622
Can one do that

259
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,974
after one gets some sleep?

260
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,843
The marks on Phillip
Van Der Hoff's hands

261
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,460
were consistent
with electrocution.

262
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:48,980
His blood boiled from the heat
of an electric shock,

263
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:50,798
which was directly
on his heart.

264
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,233
How does one
achieve that?

265
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:55,153
By using his pacemaker
as a weapon.

266
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,438
Or it could've
just gone haywire.

267
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
They malfunction about
six percent of the time.

268
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:01,309
Have a look at this.

269
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,977
Premier Cardiac Monitoring,

270
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,830
the country's leading
manufacturer of pacemakers.

271
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:08,783
They just issued a press release
announcing start of work

272
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:11,703
on a device
which cannot be hacked.

273
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:14,405
That would imply that

274
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:15,840
it is possible to
hack a pacemaker.

275
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,559
It makes perfect sense.
If you could get

276
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,544
the device's I.D. number,
you could program it

277
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:21,279
to do whatever
you wanted it to do,

278
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,214
including delivering
an electric shock

279
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:25,934
large enough to induce
a fatal heart attack.

280
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,052
So subtle it wouldn't
even seem like a murder.

281
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:29,503
You think Moran
was right?

282
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:31,072
I no longer believe we're trying

283
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:33,157
to find out if
Phillip Van Der Hoff was killed;

284
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:35,460
I think we're trying
to learn who did it.

285
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,780
What's with the
big band music?

286
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,982
I was thinking about
bootleg alcohol this morning.

287
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:43,318
Reminded me I haven't listened
to Bix Beiderbecke

288
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,619
in quite some time.

289
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:47,655
And the doll
being burned at the stake?

290
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:50,074
I'm in a dispute
with a theologist about Galileo.

291
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,793
How much do you know
about Prohibition?

292
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:53,027
The normal amount.

293
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,662
Just the broad strokes, then.

294
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:57,665
America, in a fit of Puritanism,
banned alcohol...

295
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,567
for more than a decade.

296
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,869
But the human urge to pursue
altered states persisted,

297
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,671
resulting in widespread
flouting of the law

298
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:06,707
in underground saloons
called "speakeasies."

299
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,811
Did we quit the Van Der Hoff
case while I was asleep?

300
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,512
In addition to heading up
his charitable foundation,

301
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:13,181
Phillip Van Der Hoff
is also a member

302
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:16,050
of New York City's
Landmark Protection Council,

303
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,718
11 souls whose
responsibility it is

304
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,354
to determine
the landmark status

305
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,823
of historical buildings
in the city.

306
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,858
You think that had something
to do with him being killed?

307
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,078
The council was reviewing the
landmark status of the Taggart

308
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,030
Speakeasy Museum.
It's an old grocer's

309
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:31,749
on Chamber Street
with a speakeasy in the back,

310
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,735
preserved exactly as it was
in the 1920s-- lovely.

311
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:36,404
The site's owners--

312
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:37,839
some shell corporation--

313
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,874
have applied to have
the landmark status removed.

314
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:42,343
This would free them up
to redevelop the site

315
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:45,346
for more modern, and presumably,
more profitable purposes.

316
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:46,798
The owners have applied
three times

317
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,884
to have the status changed
over recent years.

318
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:52,804
Each time, more council members
change their votes,

319
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:55,473
inching them closer and closer
to the majority needed

320
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:57,475
to have landmark status revoked.

321
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:00,612
Now, a quick check
of city records reveals

322
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:01,896
that each council member

323
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:03,781
who has changed his or her vote
also applied

324
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:07,235
for a home remodeling permit
shortly thereafter,

325
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:12,073
and in each case,
the renovation was handled by...

326
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,791
Robert Baumann.

327
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,544
Yeah, I've seen his picture
in the papers.

328
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:17,945
How does he get his teeth

329
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:19,547
so white?

330
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:21,633
You know him
because he builds skyscrapers

331
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,334
and yet here
we have him handling

332
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,336
piddling kitchen redos.

333
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:26,921
They're bribes, you see?

334
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:29,424
Change your vote,
get the redo of your choice.

335
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,225
So this is the guy who is trying

336
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:32,894
to get the landmark
status overturned?

337
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:35,063
And he's only
one council member short

338
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,231
of a majority,
until, that is, two nights ago.

339
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,017
The last thing
Phillip Van Der Hoff did

340
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,985
before he died
was change his vote

341
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,854
on the Taggart Speakeasy Museum.

342
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:45,473
So you think that bleach-teeth
killed him?

343
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:47,992
I would very much like to hear
what he has to say about it.

344
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,669
...because the company's called
Baumann and Associates,

345
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:17,405
that's why. I'm Baumann.

346
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,639
You're an associate.

347
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,893
No, no, no,
don't you...

348
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,778
How many times do I have
to tell you?

349
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,926
No!

350
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,181
Yeah, look,
I appreciate that it's a

351
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:28,616
tough position for you,
but there's just no way...

352
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:30,568
Try saying "excuse me",

353
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,036
dildo.

354
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,807
Mr. Baumann's
skull was crushed

355
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,909
by a falling
air conditioning unit.

356
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,511
Yeah, came from
the window

357
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,313
right there.

358
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:52,131
What are the odds, huh?

359
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,483
What are the odds, indeed.

360
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,769
No, there's no way.

361
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:58,304
You'd have to have
perfect timing,

362
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,740
an expert grasp
of physics.

363
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:03,025
It's got to be
a stroke of bad luck.

364
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:23,262
Hey, tell me

365
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,514
you did not just throw an
air conditioner from the roof.

366
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:28,184
The math is not quite as hard
as you might imagine.

367
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:29,969
I'm not talking
about how hard it is.

368
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:31,888
I am talking about the fact
that you could kill somebody.

369
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,222
I checked the courtyard before
I dropped it,

370
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:34,891
and I hit the X
I drew on the ground

371
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:36,642
on the very first attempt,
I might add.

372
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:38,277
With a bit of practice,

373
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,979
I'm sure a moving target
would not be that difficult.

374
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:43,149
This case is turning out
to be quite fascinating, Watson.

375
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:46,986
Bleach-teeth was obviously
not in charge of the scheme

376
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:49,188
to decertify
the Taggart Museum,

377
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,656
but he was big in real estate.

378
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:52,575
So he probably facilitated
the introductions

379
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,526
on behalf
of the actual mastermind,

380
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,246
then got an AC unit dropped
on his head for his troubles.

381
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:58,331
Why?
Well, he obviously

382
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,799
had a cut of whatever money

383
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,000
that they stood to make.

384
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:02,335
Now that he served his purpose,

385
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,886
somebody no longer
wanted to pay.

386
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:05,721
Hmm, someone-- whoever was
behind the shell company

387
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:07,173
that owns the museum.

388
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,141
Untraceable shell corporation,

389
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:10,709
a scheme to make millions

390
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:13,346
by revoking the landmark status
of an old building,

391
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,982
and murder by home appliance.

392
00:18:15,984 --> 00:18:18,517
We're obviously pursuing
a lively intellect.

393
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,653
You're back to believing
that Moriarty exists?

394
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:23,155
Call the man commissioning
these crimes whatever you want.

395
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:25,691
I'm now more and more convinced
that we're in pursuit

396
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:26,909
of one of his agents.

397
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:28,560
He does the same kind of work

398
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:30,446
that Moran does,
but in a very different way.

399
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:31,831
This man specializes in murders

400
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,866
that do not appear
to be murders at all.

401
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,451
If Moran was a sledgehammer,

402
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:38,004
our current quarry
is the scalpel.

403
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:39,922
And how do we catch
our current quarry?

404
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:41,407
First, I'm gonna clean up
the air conditioner.

405
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:43,259
Then it's quite obvious
what we need to do.

406
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:44,427
We need to plan a murder.

407
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,712
As New Yorkers,

408
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:48,130
we have to be vigilant

409
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,382
about preserving the landmarks

410
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,100
that make our city great.

411
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:53,269
When we give away pieces
of our history,

412
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,054
we give away who we are.

413
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:57,974
Meet Hillary Taggart,
an attorney,

414
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:01,811
and the last living relative
of Al "The Prawn" Taggart,

415
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:03,762
owner of the grocery store

416
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,148
which housed his
eponymous speakeasy.

417
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,600
She's an advocate for
preserving the Taggart Museum

418
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,536
exactly as it is.

419
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:12,938
The only advocate for it,
as far as I can tell.

420
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,740
Well, it's good
to have a hobby.

421
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:17,209
Even if that hobby puts you
in danger of being killed.

422
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,245
This footage is taken
from the last time

423
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,430
the museum status came up
for review.

424
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:24,083
Each time it does, Ms. Taggart
does a very good job

425
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:26,802
of making a nuisance of herself
on the building's behalf.

426
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:29,055
She threatens lawsuits,
she sends out press releases.

427
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:31,924
One can only imagine
how she will react

428
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:34,927
when word of the council's
latest vote gets out.

429
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,746
She'll probably kick up
a very public stink.

430
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:38,397
She's the next target.

431
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,966
If I was a sociopath, and
I wanted to stop anyone

432
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:44,520
from taking too close a look
at my murderous transaction,

433
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:46,789
I would remove Ms. Taggart
from the chessboard.

434
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,441
But we need to warn her.

435
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,026
We'll do no such thing.

436
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:52,411
Our mission is
to study this woman

437
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,697
to observe her
in her natural habitat.

438
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:56,782
No, the best way to
keep this woman safe

439
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:59,001
is to find out
how to kill her.

440
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:02,421
Hillary Taggart
is unmarried.

441
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:05,124
She's worked half the day
at the legal aid clinic,

442
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:07,209
and the remainder of her time
has been devoted

443
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:09,812
to various volunteer efforts.

444
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:17,269
You all right?

445
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:19,688
Yes, sorry,
thought I noticed something odd.

446
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,308
Anyway, as I was saying,

447
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,343
the rest of her time
seems to be devoted

448
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:25,677
to running laps at the pace

449
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,530
of third-grader with
a sprained ankle.

450
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:28,814
One more thing.

451
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,449
Look at her bracelet.

452
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,952
See how you can make out
part of the Rod of Asclepius?

453
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,820
She's wearing
a medical alert.

454
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,322
Huh.

455
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:39,708
Could be hemophilia,
epilepsy, a nasty allergy.

456
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,579
Right, brilliant.

457
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:46,749
A man after my own heart.

458
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:51,620
Come on if you're coming.

459
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:55,808
What kind of an allergy requires
a medical alert bracelet?

460
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,061
Uh, anything that could
bring on anaphylactic shock,

461
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:02,565
certain foods,
medicine, insect bites.

462
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,216
Exactly. A moment ago,

463
00:21:04,218 --> 00:21:06,885
I could have sworn I saw
an Africanized honeybee.

464
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,938
How do you
"Africanize" something?

465
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,008
It's a term to describe a
particularly aggressive species.

466
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,560
It's odd to...

467
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:15,911
Odd to see them here.

468
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:18,230
They're not native
to New York.

469
00:21:18,232 --> 00:21:21,900
It's almost as if someone
has placed it here

470
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:24,236
on a route known
to be frequented

471
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:25,621
by Hillary Taggart.

472
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:27,906
So you think he's planning
a murder by bee?

473
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:32,378
The hive
will be facing southeast

474
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,079
in dappled sunlight

475
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:37,082
with minimal wind.

476
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:38,801
And here they are,

477
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:40,603
newly formed

478
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,805
and flourishing.

479
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:44,256
Oh, yes.

480
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:47,726
And here is the food source.

481
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:55,234
Someone's feeding them
sugar water

482
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,119
so they multiply even faster.

483
00:21:57,121 --> 00:21:59,205
Well, it's pretty baroque way
to kill someone, isn't it?

484
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,490
I mean, cultivate bees,
feed them, and then

485
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:04,276
poke the hive with a stick every
time Hillary Taggart runs by?

486
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,045
Well, he might be
planning to swipe her

487
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:08,280
with lemongrass
oil beforehand,

488
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:10,282
make sure they're
attracted to her.

489
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:11,800
It's actually quite
a tidy plan.

490
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:13,636
You know, she flees,
bees sting--

491
00:22:13,638 --> 00:22:15,004
tragic accident.

492
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:16,555
If she's that allergic
to bee stings,

493
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:18,224
then she's gonna have
an EpiPen.

494
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:20,342
Well, an EpiPen would work
against one or two stings,

495
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:21,560
but how effective is it gonna be

496
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:24,647
against an army
of bee assassins?

497
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:26,482
If the man
we are looking for

498
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:27,799
is feeding these bees,

499
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,068
he's gonna have to come
here eventually.

500
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,469
Yeah.
Quite soon, I'd imagine,

501
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:32,304
'cause the sugar water's
getting low.

502
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,606
Ugh, great.

503
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:36,808
So we get to stake out
a hive of killer bees.

504
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:41,480
The closest place
open was Polish.

505
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:43,482
I hope you like pierozkis.

506
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:47,319
So, yesterday you said that
I was getting ahead of myself.

507
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:50,289
Well, now we know that
Phillip Van Der Hoff was murdered,

508
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,258
there's been another death,

509
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,093
and we are sitting
here waiting for

510
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,095
someone we think
works for Moriarty.

511
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:59,265
So I-I want to know
what our plan is

512
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:00,549
if we catch this man.

513
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,718
I also need to know
that this time,

514
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,688
it will not involve you
skewering someone with a knife.

515
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,608
Obviously, I do not intend

516
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,644
to turn this man
over to the police.

517
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:14,179
I intend to find out
who murdered Irene.

518
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,332
And once I've found
the person responsible,

519
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,517
I will not be resorting
to the same tactics

520
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,869
I employed against
Sebastian Moran, okay?

521
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,325
Well, you know,

522
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:28,527
you never regretted it
last time, so I...

523
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,246
again, what is
different now?

524
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,248
Well, quite frankly,
I'm surprised you have to ask.

525
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:37,369
When I pursued Moran...

526
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:41,507
my entire life I had made
one meaningful connection.

527
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,008
That was with Irene Adler.

528
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,727
Hmm?

529
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:46,729
You were preparing
to take on a new client,

530
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:49,047
I had every reason to believe
that I would be returning

531
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:51,383
to the solitary methods of old.

532
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:54,103
Since then, we've entered
into a partnership.

533
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:56,438
It's an arrangement
which I find very rewarding.

534
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,723
You're an interesting project,

535
00:23:57,725 --> 00:24:00,726
and I-I enjoy
watching your progress.

536
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:04,396
The thing that's
different about me,

537
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:06,198
empirically speaking...

538
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,583
is you.

539
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:15,874
That is one of
the nicest things

540
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,409
anyone has ever
said to me.

541
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:26,585
As I said,
it's an empirical observation.

542
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:30,222
I'd like to promise you that...

543
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:32,107
when I find the people
responsible for her death,

544
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:33,275
I won't hurt them.

545
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:34,810
Just as I'd like
to promise you

546
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:36,729
that if I found a syringe
of heroin tomorrow,

547
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:38,397
I won't shoot it into my arm.

548
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,767
Can't know that, though, can I?

549
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,158
In the meantime, you'll just
have to trust my intent.

550
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:54,380
Better decide quickly, though.

551
00:24:54,382 --> 00:24:56,048
Beekeeper approaches.

552
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,583
He's refilling the water.

553
00:24:57,585 --> 00:24:59,301
What-what do we do?

554
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:01,637
Well, I said
I wouldn't torture him.

555
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:04,122
Doesn't mean I'm going to
end this with lively debate.

556
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:11,013
Excuse me.
We're with the NYPD.

557
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:12,981
We need to take a look
at your notebook.

558
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:15,801
These are interesting
calculations.

559
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:17,403
They appear to track
the trajectory

560
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:18,771
of a falling
air conditioning unit.

561
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:20,522
What's your problem, anyway?

562
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:22,358
You can't arrest me
for doing physics.

563
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,609
Give it to me!

564
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:25,477
Oh, we're not going
to arrest you.

565
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:28,697
You're going to help us
find your employer.

566
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:40,430
Good evening.

567
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:42,116
Welcome to our home.

568
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:49,289
We know your name is
Daniel Gottlieb,

569
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,958
that you retired
from your career

570
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,162
as an engineer
several years ago,

571
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:58,499
and that you've carried out
a number of murders

572
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:02,436
on behalf of
a mysterious employer.

573
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:05,072
Let's call him...

574
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:06,390
Moriarty.

575
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:09,009
We found information in here

576
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:10,894
that ties you to the deaths of
Phillip Van Der Hoff

577
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:12,412
and Robert Baumann.

578
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,233
We can make your career
as a murderer

579
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:17,734
a matter of record.

580
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:20,154
You've received a number of
encrypted texts,

581
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:22,639
similar to those
which we found on the phone

582
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,741
of a serial killer

583
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:26,994
named Sebastian Moran.

584
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:29,113
So, a bargain:

585
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:30,864
I'm going to go
in the other room.

586
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:32,616
I'm going to send
a text message

587
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:33,984
from your phone,

588
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,652
saying something's gone wrong.

589
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:37,337
I will demand

590
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,239
a face-to-face meeting
with your employer.

591
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:42,075
If, by the time
I receive a response,

592
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:44,812
you've told me everything
that you know about Moriarty,

593
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:47,848
I will impose on
my friends at the NYPD

594
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,249
to get you special treatment
in prison.

595
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:50,884
If you don't say anything,

596
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,836
we're just gonna hand you over
to the police.

597
00:26:56,141 --> 00:26:59,226
Ring that when you decide
what you want to do.

598
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:10,821
Aren't you even
a little nervous?

599
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:12,706
I mean, somebody
is sending those texts--

600
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,992
call him Moriarty,
call him whatever you want.

601
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,127
He's behind God knows
how many murders,

602
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,379
and he's about to give you
his undivided attention.

603
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:20,797
Do you want some tea?

604
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,249
No, I want a drink.

605
00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:25,135
Sorry.

606
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:45,405
You're going to be disappointed.

607
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:47,157
I don't know who he is.

608
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,444
I don't really
know anything about him.

609
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:52,079
How many people
have you killed?

610
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:54,364
Thirty-one.

611
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,200
He's been...

612
00:27:56,202 --> 00:27:58,769
active in New York
these past few years.

613
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:03,907
Sebastian Moran was a notorious
hard man in Shoreditch.

614
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,343
It's easy to see how he came
to Moriarty's attention.

615
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:08,462
You worked a desk job.

616
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:10,380
How were you recruited?

617
00:28:10,382 --> 00:28:12,933
Eight years ago...

618
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:15,969
we were doing
an environmental impact study

619
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:18,222
for a company based in the UK.

620
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:21,024
I was working late one night.

621
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:23,994
This tall guy sits down
next to me.

622
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,146
He doesn't give a me...

623
00:28:26,148 --> 00:28:29,099
just says he's our client.

624
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,536
He was British. Striking.

625
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:35,739
He said he wanted
to take me to dinner

626
00:28:35,741 --> 00:28:39,543
to discuss the fact
that I'm a serial killer.

627
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:41,628
He found you out.

628
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,280
How?

629
00:28:43,282 --> 00:28:46,833
He claimed to be experienced
at picking out psychopaths

630
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:48,252
who were trying to "pass."

631
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:50,804
He said he'd be in touch.

632
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:52,789
I never saw him again.

633
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,309
It was all on the phone,
after that.

634
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:57,678
What else did he say to you
that night?

635
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,097
What, about himself?

636
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:01,598
Mm... you know...

637
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,985
He mentioned he spent time
in a reform school

638
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:07,137
when he was a kid.

639
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:08,939
One more thing:

640
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:11,325
I know you.

641
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:13,243
Your face.

642
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:16,330
I was doing some work for him
in London a few years ago.

643
00:29:16,332 --> 00:29:19,533
I got a text with your picture.

644
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:22,919
You were dabbling in drugs.

645
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:26,623
I had an accidental overdose
lined up for you.

646
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,509
Dissolute man-child
gives himself a hot shot.

647
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:30,994
Who'd look twice?

648
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,466
But I got another message:
"job cancelled."

649
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:39,386
That was the only time
that ever happened.

650
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:48,929
They have agreed
to a meeting.

651
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:52,899
At the Parthenon.

652
00:29:57,405 --> 00:30:00,123
The man Gottlieb described...

653
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,576
he picked out a serial killer
on a hunch.

654
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,461
He'd have to be observant
to do that; brilliant.

655
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:07,364
You think Gottlieb
met Moriarty?

656
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,532
I don't know.

657
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:11,034
But I can't help but wonder

658
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:13,170
if we've had our first
description of the man.

659
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,538
I wouldn't expect him
to show up here,

660
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,374
if he's even
in the country.

661
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:18,725
But Gottlieb is already late,

662
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,710
and someone in there
is waiting for him.

663
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:23,096
The guy with the turban
doesn't have any food.

664
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,232
His wife is pregnant
and using the restroom.

665
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:28,402
He's just indulging her
late-night cravings.

666
00:30:29,904 --> 00:30:33,323
Look at the booth
to the right of them.

667
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:36,026
He's doing his best
to appear strung out.

668
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:37,444
He's had a manicure
quite recently,

669
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:38,779
and he just checked the time

670
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:42,732
on his limited edition
U-boat watch.

671
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:46,753
Yeah, he'd have to tell someone
that Gottlieb didn't show.

672
00:30:56,414 --> 00:30:58,081
Try not to follow
too closely.

673
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,750
Don't lose him altogether,
though.

674
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:16,450
Looks like he just
got stood up.

675
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:25,575
What's he doing?

676
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:30,080
He's waiting to see if anyone's
trying to follow him.

677
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,668
The meeting's on
the other side of the tracks.

678
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:47,481
They'll be long gone
by the time the train passes.

679
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,184
Can you see anything?

680
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,652
I don't know.

681
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,488
Hope so.

682
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:05,332
Modern cameras can capture
imagery faster

683
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:08,118
than the human eye
can process it,

684
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,339
so I set the shutter speed to
1/640 of a second,

685
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:13,673
opened the aperture wide...

686
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:14,958
You took a picture

687
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,126
between the cars
of a moving train.

688
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,427
I took a series of photos

689
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:18,661
between the cars
of a moving train.

690
00:32:18,663 --> 00:32:19,996
I also moved the camera

691
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:22,165
from left to right
to get different angles.

692
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,350
Now, no one photograph

693
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:24,935
is any good on its own,
of course,

694
00:32:24,937 --> 00:32:27,854
but look at them...

695
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:30,223
as a whole...

696
00:32:36,364 --> 00:32:37,898
That's him.

697
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,867
That's the man
who took me to dinner.

698
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:05,701
What time is it?

699
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:07,136
Middle of the workday
in England.

700
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,906
So, the man at the train tracks.

701
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,407
We thought he may be British,

702
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,877
we thought he may have spent
time at a reform school.

703
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:17,713
There are only so many reform
schools in England,

704
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:21,250
and only so many prisoners
in each of them.

705
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:22,584
Aren't these
records sealed?

706
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,169
Oh, yeah.

707
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,772
They don't want just
anyone looking at 'em.

708
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:29,108
I still have contacts
in Britain.

709
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:33,863
That's him.

710
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:35,264
"John Douglas."

711
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:37,616
He was brilliant,
even as a boy.

712
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:39,118
Lethal, too.

713
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
While at the Bodwin
Reform School for Boys,

714
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:42,404
his dear friend
and roommate,

715
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:44,073
Randall Breen,
was beaten to death

716
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,491
by a group of older boys.

717
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:47,276
Within six months
of his death,

718
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:49,495
three of his
assailants were dead.

719
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:51,580
You think it was Douglas?

720
00:33:51,582 --> 00:33:53,382
They couldn't prove it.
But they transferred him

721
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:55,084
to another reform school,
and the deaths stopped.

722
00:33:55,086 --> 00:33:56,919
Well, maybe he has a record
as an adult

723
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:59,505
that can help us
track him down, huh?

724
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:02,074
John Douglas was released
on his 18th birthday.

725
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:04,810
Since then, not a whisper of him
in the system.

726
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:07,096
I think it unlikely he's used
his own name

727
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:09,464
in the last 45 years.

728
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:14,019
I believe he's assumed
another identity.

729
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:15,971
Moriarty?

730
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,523
If that's the man
we're looking for,

731
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:19,108
I doubt it's the only alias
that he uses.

732
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,609
So how do we find him?

733
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,313
I don't know.

734
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:36,458
"I was closer to the truth
than I let on.

735
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,378
"Off to see what I'd do when
presented with a loaded syringe.

736
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,931
"My apologies for
abandoning you

737
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:45,217
as our drama
approaches its climax."

738
00:34:51,024 --> 00:34:53,842
Good morning,
John Douglas.

739
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,780
Holmes!

740
00:34:57,782 --> 00:35:00,699
I took the liberty of
disassembling your pistol.

741
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:06,288
How did you find me?

742
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,157
I have Gottlieb.

743
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,326
I arranged the meeting
last night.

744
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:11,360
I followed your man.

745
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:12,778
As for you,
you're registered

746
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,213
in this hotel under
the name

747
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,081
Randall Breen.

748
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:19,218
Same as your cell mate
in Bodwin.

749
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:22,871
What's in the bag?

750
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:26,025
The instruments
of your slow demise.

751
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,445
Do you do business
under the name "Moriarty"?

752
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:33,432
I'm... not him.

753
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:37,853
I could never be him.

754
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:39,238
Yes, by all means,

755
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,157
tell me more about
his unfathomable genius.

756
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,427
I know why
you're looking for him.

757
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:48,730
You want to know about Irene.

758
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:52,334
I didn't kill her.

759
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:55,904
But I know
what happened.

760
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,641
I could tell you why
she had to die.

761
00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:02,378
It was because of you, Holmes.

762
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:17,810
I just talked to the detective
who caught the case.

763
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:19,278
She says you were
in the room

764
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,096
when this guy Douglas
got taken out,

765
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:25,534
but you have no idea
why it happened.

766
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:26,935
Right.

767
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,404
It would appear
someone didn't want us

768
00:36:28,406 --> 00:36:30,656
to finish the conversation
we were having.

769
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:33,125
What the hell is going
on with you?

770
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:36,879
What did Moran say
to you the other day?

771
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:39,465
There's someone else
involved;

772
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:42,384
someone who texted
those pictures to Moran.

773
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,386
He had a similar arrangement
with the man

774
00:36:44,388 --> 00:36:45,954
I'm about
to hand off to you.

775
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,673
I've committed myself
to finding this person.

776
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:48,724
I give you my word:

777
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:49,975
I will not repeat
the tactics

778
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:51,894
that put you and I
at odds back then.

779
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:54,730
I wish your word meant
something more to me.

780
00:36:54,732 --> 00:36:56,482
I know.
Thank you.

781
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:59,101
Which is why I have
a character witness.

782
00:36:59,103 --> 00:37:00,319
Are you all right?

783
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,321
I'm quite fine.
Watson, I was just

784
00:37:02,323 --> 00:37:05,274
telling Captain Gregson
that I'm a changed man.

785
00:37:05,276 --> 00:37:07,476
That he needn't worry
that I'll hold myself apart

786
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,278
from the norms
of decent behavior.

787
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,029
That's my old medical bag.

788
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,868
Legos?

789
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,652
Yean, the bag needed
a certain heft

790
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:21,039
if it was gonna fool
John Douglas.

791
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:24,126
I just bred an antibiotic-
resistant strain of rubella.

792
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:28,180
This guy has given us
18 murders so far.

793
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:30,466
He has no interest
in an attorney.

794
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:32,267
He just wants to talk.

795
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:33,635
He's had to keep
his "project""

796
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:35,537
to himself
all these years.

797
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,356
Probably relieved to
finally have an audience.

798
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:42,394
Gottlieb's getting
a text.

799
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:43,729
What does it say?

800
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:51,820
What's he saying to you?

801
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,090
I-I don't know.

802
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:56,458
I-I can't read it.
Tell me!

803
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,044
That's not the code we used.

804
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,462
If you want to read
that message,

805
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:03,332
you're going to have
to translate it yourself.

806
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:16,061
Do you need something
from me, partner?

807
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:24,686
Your colleague's in custody.

808
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:27,722
A man named John Douglas
is in the morgue.

809
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,057
Do you know him?

810
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,492
You know, me and you

811
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:32,694
can take this all
the way to the top.

812
00:38:32,696 --> 00:38:36,498
What's it take
to crease that mug?

813
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,235
I gave you a good haul
last time, didn't I?

814
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,405
Tell me what this says.

815
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:47,209
What, the great Sherlock Holmes
couldn't crack it?

816
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:48,844
I'm working on it.

817
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:51,013
If you could speed
things up for me,

818
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:52,747
then I won't have to.

819
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:59,454
Go to the incoming text log.

820
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:10,098
Now back to the message.

821
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,911
What does it say?

822
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:26,615
I don't know.

823
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:28,950
It's not the code
we used to use.

824
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,302
Bollocks. You're lying.

825
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,637
Nope.

826
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,555
Someone's winding you up, mate.

827
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:34,806
Tell me what it says, Moran.

828
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:36,091
I'm done here!

829
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:37,175
Tell me what it says.

830
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:40,962
Tell me what it says.
Leave it.

831
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:59,147
You didn't get
much sleep last night.

832
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:02,117
No. I've almost cracked this.

833
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,503
I've identified
the type of cipher.

834
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,705
All that remains
is for me to ascertain

835
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,874
the three-digit sequence
that will decode it.

836
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:10,842
Well, it is 10:17 right now.

837
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:13,378
Let's say by 11:00
you haven't cracked it,

838
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,996
we both get some rest, okay?

839
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:16,782
The code'll be there
in the morning.

840
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:19,000
10:17. Thank you.

841
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,686
Watson, you know...

842
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:22,354
some people--
without possessing genius--

843
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:24,523
have a remarkable knack
for stimulating it.

844
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,525
Oh, an insult and a boast.

845
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:29,227
10:17.
Moran looked at the time;

846
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:32,698
he needed to see
when the message was sent.

847
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,417
4:32.

848
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:37,736
That's when
this message was sent

849
00:40:37,738 --> 00:40:39,371
and that is the decryption key.

Holmes.

866
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:43,802
Captain, Sebastian Moran

867
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:45,137
is going to attempt suicide.

868
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:48,106
You need to call the warden
at Newgate.

869
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,941
I just got off the phone
with him.

870
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:52,944
Moran slammed his head against
the wall at least a dozen times.

871
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:54,146
Is he alive?

872
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:57,366
Well, he was as of five minutes
ago, but, uh...

873
00:41:57,368 --> 00:42:00,369
the swelling in his brain,
it's bad.

874
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:02,621
They don't expect him
to last the night.

875
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:09,244
He had you bring
the message to Moran.

876
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,881
You couldn't have known.

877
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:14,800
Yeah, you know, that's what
idiots tell themselves

878
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,418
when they've
been outsmarted.

879
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,952
Twice Moriarty has
had me in his sights

880
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:19,254
and twice he's let me go:

881
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:20,955
once when he hired
Gottlieb to kill me,

882
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,674
and again this morning.

883
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:24,125
I don't know
what his game is.

884
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,762
It seems like
maybe you're the game.

885
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,185
That's Gottlieb's phone.

886
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:44,529
This is Sherlock Holmes.

887
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:47,165
Yes. Thank you. Well aware.

888
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,917
And whom do I have
the pleasure of speaking to?

889
00:42:48,919 --> 00:42:52,646
My name is Moriarty. I believe
we're overdue for a chat.
