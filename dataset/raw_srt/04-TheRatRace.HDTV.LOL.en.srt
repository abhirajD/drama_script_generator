Hey, all I did was give you
some fresh eyes.

2
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:13,139
Ms. Watson.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,848
I didn't know you and Holmes
were stopping by.

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,382
He's not here, just me.

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,850
Everything okay?

6
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:20,486
Uh, could we talk privately?

7
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,521
I haven't heard from him
in over three hours.

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,923
He's not responding to texts,

9
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,691
he's not answering his phone.

10
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,761
All due respect, but you know
your boss is a weirdo, right?

11
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:32,298
He's probably out trying
to find Jimmy Hoffa

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,999
in some, uh, subway tunnel.

13
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,302
You don't understand.
We have an arrangement.

14
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:38,137
We're not supposed to be apart
for more than two hours,

15
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,972
and he's never
supposed to be unreachable.

16
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,341
I know you two are pretty close
for an assistant and a boss,

17
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,893
but how is that even possible?

18
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,544
You both have to sleep, right?

19
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,813
I'm... not his assistant.

20
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,382
I... okay, the only reason
we are together all the time

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,284
is because I live at his place.

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,020
Okay.

23
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:58,724
Don't know why you guys couldn't
have just told me that,

24
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,192
but... fine.

25
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,660
Okay, it's not like that.

26
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,130
It's... we're not
together together.

27
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,332
Okay, what is it like?

00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,569
I-I...

29
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,138
I-I can't say, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,939
Well, Ms. Watson, if you
want me to help you,

31
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,375
you're gonna have to tell me
what the story is, all right?

32
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,852
I'm a sober companion.

33
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,687
I work with recovering
drug addicts.

Sherlock is my client.

00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,274
His father hired me
to help him stay clean.

36
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:34,076
The only reason
I am telling you this

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,878
is because I think
he may have relapsed.

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,080
I need your help to find him.

39
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,791

but what is "IMLTHO"?

Language is evolving, Watson,

104
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,590
A handsome one, at that.

105
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,626
Um, this is the part
where I ask you

106
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:43,893
how you knew that, right?

107
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,178
You put your hair up

108
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,713
when you want to look your best.

109
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,098
You think it's more flattering.

110
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,216
You're wrong, of course.
It's a draw.

111
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:52,102
But it was down when you left
for coffee, and now it's up.

112
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,237
Ergo, you unexpectedly
met a man

113
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,488
you found attractive.

114
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,990
Okay, what am I
doing here, anyway?

115

for more than two hours,

119
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:05,415

errand to run,

120
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,167
and I have no idea
how long it's gonna take.

121
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,451
What kind of errand?

122
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,120
We have been summoned

of Canon-Ebersole.

124
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,524
The investment firm. What do
they want to see you about?

125
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:15,925
I have no idea.

126
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,178
Hence my use of
the word "mysterious."

127
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,413
Apparently Gregson
recommended my services,

128
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:22,382
and, uh, they won't
tell me anything else

129
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:25,018
until I've signed
a confidentiality agreement.

130
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,886
Uh, is that what
you're going to wear?

131
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,888
What's wrong with it?

132
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,558
It... I'm pretty sure you slept
in that T-shirt last night,

133
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,978
and, um, the guys on Wall
Street are a little more...

134
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,696
formal in the way they dress.

135
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:38,198
Those are costumes.

136
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,367
I loathe bankers.

137
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,985
They rigged the roulette wheel
of commerce,

138
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:43,536
very nearly destroyed
the world economy,

139
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:45,905
and they still think
if they wear suits

140
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:47,157
they'll be treated
like respectable folk

141
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,776
instead of the crooks
that they are.

00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,356
Mm.

149
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:06,476
This is our COO, Peter Talbott.

150
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:08,978
Every quarter, he fields
a conference call with

151
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,764
our institutional investors.

152
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,633
These people control
huge pension funds.

153
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:16,069
As far as they're concerned,
Peter's the voice of the company.

154
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,321
This quarter's call was
supposed to happen yesterday.

155
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:21,374
We had to reschedule,
because Peter didn't show up.

156
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,159
Nobody has any idea
where he is.

157
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:25,195
And if you don't get this
call back on the books soon,

158
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:26,996
people will start to whisper.

159
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:30,083
When these people whisper,
Mr. Holmes,

160
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,451
millions of dollars disappear.

161

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:35,121
a, uh, Captain Gregson,

163
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,723
he said that the NYPD
couldn't get involved

164
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,792
until Peter had been
missing for two days.

165
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:40,293
He also said that

166
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,512
you were the finest
investigator he'd ever known.

167
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:46,099
We'd like to hire you
and your, uh... associate.

168
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,217
Bodyguard.

169
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,602
Luckily for you,
Mr. Fowkes,

170
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,221
I have a hole in my schedule.

171
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,390
My usual private consulting
rates will apply, of course,

172
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:56,926
multiplied by a factor
of 12, shall we say?

173
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:58,511
You're wondering
if I'm worth it.

174
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:00,780
I could provide a demonstration,
if you'd like.

175
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:02,082
I'm fairly sure,

176
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,383
for example,
that these two are

177
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:05,034
sleeping with each other.

178
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,403
You really should be more
careful of your body language.

179
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,737
And you, for some reason,

180
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,072
have recently used a solvent

181
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:11,958
to remove fingernail polish
from your hands.

182
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,360
12 times your usual rate
will be just fine.

183
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:17,547
I will need access to Peter
Talbott's office, his computer.

184
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:20,950
My secretary will be happy to
take you down there right now.

185
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,259
Cute couple.

186
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,593
Everyone here calls
Peter and Alyssa

187
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,145
"Taylor and Burton."

188
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,480
You know,
after the movie stars.

189
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:34,764
Fascinating.

190
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:38,268
I'll be outside
if you need me.

191
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,219
I don't think I've ever
seen you so happy,

192
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:41,554
back in the
conference room.

193
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:43,490
Mastering the Masters
of the Universe.

194
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:44,941
Bit of a letdown,
actually.

195
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:46,576
I think I could've got
20 times my normal rate.

196
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:49,612
What is your normal rate?
Oh, I don't have one.

197
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,531
Remind me to make one up
before I leave.

198
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,949
Typical.

199
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,784
Every stuffed shirt who
wants to pass for erudite

200
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,286
has shelves full
of unread books.

201
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:59,372
None of the spines on these
have ever been cracked.

202
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:00,957
Except...

203
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,210
this one.

204
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:07,464
Which apparently Mr. Talbott
consults all the time.

205
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:16,973
Ah.

206
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:19,258
I've never been a fan of
John Maynard Keynes,

207
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,777
but this I could
sink my teeth into.

208
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,228
I don't understand.
What is that?

209
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,780
It's a menu.

210
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,265
Each of these girls is
available for a price.

211
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:27,867
See the ring symbols
at the bottom?

212
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:31,654
The more rings, the more
expensive the prostitute.

213
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:33,823
So you're speaking
from experience?

214
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:35,959
It's just a deduction.

215
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:39,212
Though I am on
an expense account.

216
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:41,297
Almost all these pages
are turned down.

217
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,549
The more pricey girls

218
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:44,450
were his favorites.

219
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:45,835
But you can't just tell the IRS

220
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:47,637
you spend six figures
a year on slappers.

221
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,473
No, you need to
hide the expense. So...

222
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:54,894
Let's see...
calendar, contacts...

223
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,429
Yeah.

224
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:59,015
You see?

225
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:01,818
Talbott has contact addresses
for two separate accountants.

226
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,171
This one is for a rep for DDB.

227
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,490
That's a big five firm,
nothing untoward there.

228
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:09,692
Probably handled the family
books. But this one...

229
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:12,812
is an independent accountant
by the name of Martin Rydell.

230
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:17,033
Handled something Peter calls
his "Executive Private Account""

231
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,451
Excuse me!

232
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:19,919
Secretary?

233
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:22,839
What did Fowkes
say your name was?

234
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:25,208
He didn't. It's Donna.

235
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,594
Well, before we leave, Donna,
would you mind calling us in

236
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,462
a reservation for three
at Villa Pacri?

237
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:32,999
We're not dressed
for Villa Pacri.

238
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,717
We're not dressed for
Canon-Ebersole, either.

239
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,386
When I invite Martin Rydell
to lunch, it'll help if

240
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:37,887
I drop the name of one of

241
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:40,473
the most expensive
restaurants in the city.

242
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:47,030
So you loathe Canon-Ebersole
and everything they stand for.

243
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:48,565
But you love to
spend their money.

244
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,867
You don't see any
inconsistency there?

245
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:52,952
I'm redistributing as many
of their assets as I can.

246
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:55,288
If I'm going to get in bed with
the croupiers of a rigged game,

247
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,790
I'm going to make damn sure
their wallets are lighter in the morning.

248
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,611
Sir?
Mm.

249
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:01,589
And that is for?

250
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:02,913
It's the most expensive
bottle they've got.

251
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,797
I don't care if it comes in
a box, you're not drinking it.

252
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,084
It's not for me.
You see that couple over there?

253
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:10,003
I observed them
while you were in the bathroom.

254
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:12,305
The man's suit is frayed
from dry cleaning.

255
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,140
I'd wager it's
the only one he's got.

256
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:16,926
Therefore, he saved to come here
for a special occasion.

257
00:10:16,928 --> 00:10:20,179
Also, he keeps touching the
inside pocket of his suit coat,

258
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,315
like he's checking to see
that something valuable

259
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:24,651
is still there.
He's about to propose.

260
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:28,504
And I'm going to send this
wine over as congratulations.

261
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,940
It's lovely, thank you.

262
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,158
Mr. Holmes?

263
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,861
Mr. Rydell.

264
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:36,779
Won't you sit down?

265
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:42,118
Confession: I told a couple
of white lies on the phone.

266
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,287
I don't actually work
at Canon-Ebersole,

267
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,122
and I have no
intention of opening

268
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:48,791
a private executive
account with you.

269
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,576
What I would like is
to discuss the work

270
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:52,428
you did concealing Peter
Talbott's predilection

271
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,880
for expensive hookers.

272
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:57,467
I'm sorry, I think
maybe this is a mistake.

273
00:10:57,469 --> 00:10:59,385
Is it strictly legal,

274
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:01,771
the private executive accounting
business? I bet not.

275
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:03,756
Yet you seemed very eager to
take this meeting with me,

276
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:06,976
so I'm quite sure that Peter
Talbott's not the only rich man

277
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,928
to avail himself
of your services.

278
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,647
But by all means, leave.

279
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,148
I'm sure there's any
number of magazines

280
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,617
would love to
publish a story about

281
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,319
the man who hides the dirty
secrets of Wall Street.

282
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,738
The press is so
base these days.

283
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:21,290
Excuse me.

284
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,608
Hello. Is this the Post?

285
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,144
Wait!

286
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:27,964
I work with Peter.
I set up a shell corporation.

287
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:30,667
We steer a little bit
of his paycheck

288
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:32,752
into a quiet little slush fund.

289
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:34,787
He can do whatever
he wants with it.

290
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,506
And if he were using
this slush fund

291
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,041
to binge on his
favorite bad habit,

292
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,043
where do you suppose
we might find him?

293
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,896
I rented an apartment in Tribeca

294
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:45,998
under the name
of the dummy corp.

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,468
Yes, I will!
Of course I will!

296
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:53,456
That's lovely, isn't it?

297
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,442
This apartment, we'll
need the address.

298
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,594
The man you met
this morning,

299
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:00,329
his name's Aaron, yes?

300
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:03,032
He sent a text while you were
in the bathroom at lunch,

301
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:04,784
asked if you wanted
to have dinner tonight.

302
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:06,119
Didn't we already
have this conversation?

303
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,370
You don't touch
my stuff.

304
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,155
You said yes,
by the way.

305
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:11,174
And you definitely don't
accept dates on my behalf.

306
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:12,442
Why not? We're both
equally aware

307
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:14,127
that you're attracted
to this man.

308
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,012
No, we are both not equally
aware of my feelings.

309
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:18,598
Super's office.

310
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,016
Yes, this is

311
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:21,434
Detective Donowicz
of the NYPD.

312
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:24,637
We got a warrant
to look inside apartment 2G.

313
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,139
We don't have
a warrant.

314
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:27,840
They almost never
ask to see it.

315
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:36,632
This is the apartment
he kept on the side?

316
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:37,950
This place is amazing.

317
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:43,940
Mr. Talbott, your bosses
would like a word.

318
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,448
You all right?

319
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,034
I'm sure you already know
that the support meetings,

320
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:15,837
you're not even allowed to name
the drug you've abused.

321
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,088
Just saying it out loud

322
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,823
might be enough
to make someone relapse.

323
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,908
I told you I don't pay attention
in those meetings.

324
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,245
Heroin was one of the drugs
that landed you in rehab.

325
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:26,914
You're not just
hearing the word.

326
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,717
You're in a apartment where
it's laid out in front of you.

327
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,252
Do you want to get
away from this?

328
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:32,887
We can go outside
and talk.

329
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,889
I'm fine. I have to be.
I'm working a case.

330
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:37,058
And talking about
my feelings

331
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,626
is not gonna get
it solved, right?

332
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:41,379
Peter Talbott is right there.
Your job is over.

333
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:43,831
Over? Do you see that
salad sitting there?

334
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:48,803
Captain, you're classifying this
as an accidental overdose, yeah?

335
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:51,439
We'll wait on the M.E. to make
the final determination,

336
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,825
but you're looking at
the same picture we are.

337
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:55,393
Indeed. But I don't think
we need to wait on the Examiner

338
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:56,828
to get started--
I think there's a good chance

339
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,479
Peter Talbott was murdered.

340
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,947
Murdered? The guy's holding
the needle he used

341
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,332
to shoot himself up.

342
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,001
He's holding the needle that
someone used to shoot him up.

343
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:05,953
Look at his arm.
There's no track marks on it.

344
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:09,090
Doesn't mean anything-- a junkie
can find a vein anywhere.

345
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,892
Look around you.
Does this look like

346
00:14:10,894 --> 00:14:15,213
the typical apartment
of a hardcore heroin user?

347
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:17,799
It's-It's-It's pristine!

348
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,385
I'd wager even the food

349
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,137
is perfectly arranged.

350
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,224
Ha. Does that look like
the typical fridge

351
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:28,359
of a heroin addict?

352
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,528
No, not a typical one.

353
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,031
Heroin users are looking
for oblivion.

354
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,033
They want the drug
to dull their senses.

355
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,152
That's why when they overdose,
usually you find them in

356
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,288
squalid apartments
or alleyways.

357
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,374
They don't often keep apartments
like this.

358
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:47,462
And it's rare-ish that
they hold jobs as a COO

359
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:49,464
of a billion-dollar
corporation.

360
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:53,501
So you're saying someone gave
Peter Talbott that shot?

361
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:55,653
How? There's no sign
of a struggle here.

362
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:56,921
You can't walk
up to someone

363
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,973
and stick a syringe
in their arm.

364
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:02,894
No, you would need them
to be unconscious first.

365
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:06,097
Okay, granted I've never been
hit with a salad container,

366
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:08,132
but I'm pretty sure
it wouldn't knock you out.

367
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:10,485
The killer would need
Peter to be insensate

368
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:13,404
before delivering
the fatal shot.

369
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:14,689
But a drug other
than heroin would

370
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:16,307
surely show up
on tox screens.

371
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,192
So what's the most
efficient solution?

372
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,478
If Peter Talbott
was murdered,

373
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,248
I'd imagine the first dose
of heroin came from here.

374
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,451
After he passed out,

375
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:28,870
the killer dragged him

376
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:33,458
to the chair where
he delivered the fatal shot.

377
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,376
You think someone
dosed his salad dressing?

378
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:37,011
I think it's worth
exploring.

379
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,662
It's easy enough to
find out if I'm right.

380
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:39,847
We just test
the salad

381
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:41,098
for the presence
of heroin.

382
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,633
I'll hold my
breath on that.

383
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:45,102
Meantime, I got to
notify Talbott's wife

384
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,939
of all... this.
I'm coming.

385
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:50,441
He-he keeps a special
apartment for prostitutes.

386
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:53,361
If he was murdered,
surely his wife had motive.

387
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,695
You can watch.

388
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:56,347
She just lost
her husband--

389
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:59,317
the last thing she needs
to deal with right now...

390
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,319
is you.

391
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,706
Oh, my God.

392
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,959
Peter said he
was done with it all.

393
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:10,394
The girls, the partying.

394
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:12,680
He just told me
he was ready for kids

395
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:15,333
and you're saying he was using heroin?
Everything cool?

396
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,251
Our sincere condolences.
You're staring.

397
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:18,553
Ms. Talbott,

398
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,087
sorry to interrupt.

399
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,756
Would you mind telling us
where you were

400
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:24,225
two nights ago between the hours
of 6:00 and midnight?

401
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:25,843
What?
The medical examiner

402
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,061
estimates that's
when your husband died.

403
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:28,563
I was wondering
where you where.

404
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:30,064
No.
You-you think I'd hurt my husband?

405
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,517
No, no, everything
we've seen so far

406
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,768
says accidental death.

407
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,069
Even so-- your whereabouts.

408
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,154
You don't...
have to answer that.

409
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:39,240
I-I volunteer
at Habitat for Humanity.

410
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:41,108
I was at a silent auction.

411
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,911
Th-There must have been
200 people who saw me there.

412
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,346
Thank you.

413
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:46,831
And until today,

414
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,016
you had no idea your
husband was using heroin?

415
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:50,451
I told you, no.

416
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:52,036
I'm shocked.

417
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:55,339
But... I...

418
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,325
can't say I'm...

419
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:58,960
totally surprised.

420
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:01,629
He's been overwhelmed ever
since they named him COO.

421
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,265
Peter used to say he thought
the last guy dropped dead

422
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,217
just to get out of
going into work.

423
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,552
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

424
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,136
Did you just say

425
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,588
the previous
chief operating officer

426
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,890
of Canon-Ebersole also died?

427
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,393
He was allergic to peanuts--
he died when some restaurant

428
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,395
put the wrong oil
in his lunch.

429
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:18,596
How long ago was that?

430
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:19,981
Last October. Why?
What does this

431
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,198
have to do with Peter?

432
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,199
Nothing at all.

433
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:23,200
We're finished here.

434
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,935
Thank you very much

435
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:25,987
for coming in.

436
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:27,071
And again, we've very,

437
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:28,823
very sorry for your loss.

438
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:30,241
Yes.

439
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,213
Peanut allergies?

440
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:37,715
Seriously?

441
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,718
Canon-Ebersole has lost
two COO's in a year.

442
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,037
That seems like
a dangerous job.

443
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:50,794
You speak Mandarin?

444
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:52,763
Not as well as
I'd like. You?

445
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,565
Not as well as
my mother would like.

446
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,766
Who was that?

447
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:57,735
The chef that
prepared the meal

448
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:00,738
that killed Peter Talbott's predecessor
at Canon-Ebersole.

449
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,306
Any particular reason?

450
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:03,991
I won't get
the test results back

451
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:06,027
from Peter Talbott's salad
for a couple of hours.

452
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,162
In the meantime,
I suppose I'm just curious.

453
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:10,247
The previous COO
of Canon-Ebersole

454
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,583
was a man named Gary Norris.

455
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,251
Terrible allergies.

456
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,537
Yes, noted earlier.

457
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,790
Did you know he was fanatical
about avoiding peanut products?

458
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,509
He ate every single takeout meal

459
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:23,344
from the same
Chinese restaurant.

460
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:25,463
He had a special arrangement
with the chef,

461
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:27,632
who knew never
to have peanut oil around

462
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,934
when he was preparing
Gary Norris's meals.

463
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:32,186
Well, it only takes one slip up.

464
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:34,388
But the chef swears
he didn't slip up.

465
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,224
He prepared that meal
personally, and he believes

466
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:40,061
that someone put the peanut oil
in Gary Norris's food

467
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:41,862
after it left his kitchen.

468
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:44,198
I'm starting to think
he could be right.

469
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,283
Death by peanut oil--
that would be

470
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:48,452
a brilliant way to kill someone.
Hmm.

471
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:51,739
If Peter Talbott was murdered,
the M.O. is consistent:

472
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,407
eliminate your target

473
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:55,859
in a way that the world thinks
is an accident.

474
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,995
Damn it!

475
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:03,951
Earlier, when I asked you
about being around heroin again,

476
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:06,420
you wanted to say something?

477
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:08,072
I could tell.

478
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:11,592
I'd forgotten
what it smells like.

479
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:14,845
Cooked heroin.

480
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:22,570
It brought back memories.

481
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:25,272
that they crave oblivion.

482
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,525
Is that what you wanted?

483
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:28,892
It's nearly 7:00.

484
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:30,695
You're gonna miss
your dinner date.

485
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:32,313
I'm not going.
You need me tonight.

486
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:33,748
Actually...

487
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,501
what I need, I believe,
is privacy tonight.

488
00:19:37,503 --> 00:19:39,253
I'm not gonna
relapse.

489
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:42,072
Besides, if I wanted drugs,
I could always just

490
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:44,792
climb out the window,
whether you're here or not.

491
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:46,794
Go.

492
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:50,314
If it makes you happy, I'll take
a spit test when you get back.

493
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,884
All right.

494
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:05,146
I am officially
calling it.

495
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:07,231
"Foam" is-is not
a category of food.

496
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,949
It just isn't.

497
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:11,318
I feel like I should
take you to a restaurant

498
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,987
that provides
actual sustenance.

499
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:15,206
That's all right.
After all the bubbles subsided,

500
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,607
there was food underneath.

501
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,209
No, you're
missing my point.

502
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:20,294
Can't you see that's
my stealthy way

503
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:22,379
of asking you out
on another date.

504
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:24,281
Oh, smooth!

505
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:27,418
Yeah. So smooth you
didn't even notice.

506
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,920
No, I didn't.
I was...

507
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:32,790
Seriously, though,
I... I had fun.

508
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,643
Most of my dates
these days

509
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:37,728
are spent talking
about ex-husbands.

510
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,346
You didn't go there.

511
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:41,065
Well, that's easy--
I've never been married.

512
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,300
What about you?
No.

513
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:52,810
Your chariot.

514
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:56,480
So, uh...

515
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:59,784
like I said,
this was fun.

516
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:01,485
It was.

517
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:05,322
Thanks.

518
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:08,209
Thank you.

519
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:15,800
Who are they?

520
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:17,384
Employees of
Canon-Ebersole

521
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,854
who have died over
the last ten years.

522
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:21,472
It is a big company.

523
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:23,641
Odds are they're gonna lose
some people along the way.

524
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:26,176
And some of these,
no doubt, are random.

525
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:28,846
But there could be a pattern
hidden in there.

526
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:31,482
How was your date?
Good.

527
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:33,117
Fun.

528
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:35,903
I think maybe
he lied to me.

529
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:38,572
It was the end of the night
and we were talking

530
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:40,324
about whether or not
we've been married,

531
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,743
and when he said he hadn't--
and this isn't something

532
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:45,162
I would've noticed before
I started working with you--

533
00:21:45,164 --> 00:21:47,882
but I... could swear
he wasn't telling the truth.

534
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:49,917
Flexing our deductive
muscles, are we?

535
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,418
I could burst with pride.

536
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,053
The next step is confirmation.

537
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:55,756
It's easy enough to find out
if he was married.

538
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,091
What was his last name?

539
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:58,475
Whoa. Hold on.

540
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:00,210
Not a cyber-stalker.

541
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:02,346
Do you want to find out
if you're right or don't you?

542
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,250
His last name is Ward.

543
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,385
Quick visit
to maritalrecords.com

544
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,938
tells us that Aaron Ward

545
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,941
of New York City was...

546
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:15,159
Oh.

547
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,650
"Oh." "Oh"-- what
does that mean?

548
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:17,611
He wasn't married.

549
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,281
- Oh.
- He is married.

550
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:22,600
To a woman
called Grace Arber.

551
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,084
They just celebrated
their anniversary.

552
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:25,669
How could Emily set me
up with a married guy?

553
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:27,621
Well, look at it this way:
your instincts were right.

554
00:22:27,623 --> 00:22:29,957
And you're home early, so
I assume you haven't become

555
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,625
an unwitting adulteress.

556
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,511
I knew it!

557
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:37,081
Knew what?
That's the NYPD lab.

558
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,683
They agreed to rush the tests
of Peter Talbott's salad

559
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:42,303
and there were trace amounts
of heroin in it.

560
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:43,771
Mm.
My advice...

561
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:45,389
don't dwell on that man's
petty deceptions.

562
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,724
You need your rest.

563
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:49,026
We're going to
Canon-Ebersole tomorrow.

564
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:50,477
We're going to call another meeting
of their Board of Directors.

565
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,646
Can you do that? You don't
even work there anymore.

566
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:54,198
Not technically, but I think

567
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,733
they're gonna want my help
in trying to figure out

568
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:57,735
whether there's a murderer
working there.

569
00:22:59,404 --> 00:23:02,773
Miles Durham, former head trader
in your Denver office.

570
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:06,243
Mr. Durham was a volunteer with
wilderness search and rescue

571
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:09,213
who always filed his travel
plans with the ranger office

572
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:10,547
whenever he went camping.

573
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:11,916
We're busy people, Mr. Holmes.

574
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:13,350
What are we doing here?

575
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:16,086
Maria Filipello.

576
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:18,172
She ran your equities
division in Dallas.

577
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:20,224
She suffocated in 2005

578
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:22,343
when the natural gas line
running into her house ruptured.

579
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,795
Never been another problem
with that brand of piping

580
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:26,513
before or since.

581
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:27,982
Jason Palmer.

582
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:29,516
He worked in
the New York office.

583
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:32,319
Got a $5 million bonus in 2009.

584
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,171
Then drowned,
while swimming in a lake

585
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:35,522
near his home
in the Catskills.

586
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:36,740
The odd things is,

587
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:38,275
when Jason Palmer
was in college,

588
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:39,944
he was a beach lifeguard
at Martha's Vineyard.

589
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:41,812
Uh, respectfully,
Mr. Holmes,

590
00:23:41,814 --> 00:23:44,865
you found Peter,
he O.D.'d, we're done.

591
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:46,066
Peter Talbott was murdered.

592
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,618
The police are
investigating now.

593
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,670
I believe the man who killed him

594
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:52,873
also killed your
previous COO, Gary Norris.

595
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,508
And these three
unfortunate souls.

596
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,909
Possibly one or two
others, as well.

597
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:58,345
I can't find a plausible
motive for anyone

598
00:23:58,347 --> 00:24:00,931
outside the company to have
committed these murders.

599
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,266
These are not crimes of passion.

600
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:03,550
They're too
well concealed for that.

601
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:05,269
They're crimes of opportunity.

602
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:07,938
I think you may have
a sociopath in your midst.

603
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,358
A particularly cunning,
methodical killer.

604
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
If I'm right,
they wait, they analyze,

605
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:15,646
and when the time is right
to give themselves a leg up,

606
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:17,264
they pounce.

607
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:20,601
You're saying someone is killing
their way up the ladder?

608
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:21,969
That sounds insane to me.

609
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:24,538
I'd love to be wrong.

610
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,641
But someone did dose Peter
Talbott's salad with heroin.

611
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:30,244
As for the rest,
you let me do my work.

612
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:32,463
I'll need access
to your records.

613
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:34,114
If this person is here,
I'll find them.

614
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:38,585
We control billions of dollars
worth of assets, Mr. Holmes.

615
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:40,854
We can't give you
access to these files.

616
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,656
They're confidential.
I don't need to audit you,

617
00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:44,358
I just need to do
some simple math.

618
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,477
There can't be that many people

619
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,095
who worked in Denver in 2003,

620
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:49,396
Dallas in 2005,

621
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:50,981
New York since 2009.

622
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:52,333
If I can find
this person quickly,

623
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,268
I can wrap this up
with a minimum of scandal.

624
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,602
All right, enough.

625
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:57,538
This is not necessary.

626
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,689
Are you listening to me?

627
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:00,341
There may be a murderer
at Canon-Ebersole.

628
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:02,326
There's not a killer.
You know how I know that?

629
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,028
Because the only person
with the career path

630
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,030
that you're describing is me.

631
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:07,448
What are you saying?

632
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,399
That I murdered, like,
what, like five people?

633
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,403
Well, this is a bit awkward,

634
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:16,290
but I-I'd say that you're
a damn good suspect.

635
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,222
I thought I'd bring you
your check personally.

636
00:25:28,224 --> 00:25:30,058
Also, we need to talk.

637
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,860
Do we?

638
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:36,397
Eggs?

639
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:37,932
I'm sure I could
find another fork.

640
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,884
I'm not hungry.
I came here to end this.

641
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,185
Well, that should be
simple enough.

642
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:42,636
Just confess.

643
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:44,939
Save us both a great deal
of time and trouble.

644
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:47,908
Do you have any idea
what you did to me today?

645
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,277
Do you know what it takes
just to survive

646
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,745
at a place
like Canon-Ebersole?

647
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:53,781
I think avoiding you
would be a good start.

648
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:56,617
I've never killed anyone.

649
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:00,921
I went to parochial school,
Mr. Holmes.

650
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:03,440
I've pretty much broken every
commandment they ever taught me.

651
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:05,926
Father Ray probably
isn't very proud of me,

652
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:08,963
but then again, Father Ray
doesn't have a country house.

653
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:11,966
I was inches away
from becoming COO,

654
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:13,450
which everybody knows

655
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,386
is where they groom you
for the big chair.

656
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:17,938
And you accuse me of murder.

657
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,441
You think everybody in
that place isn't talking?

658
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:23,310
Gossip's poison
in that place.

659
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:25,079
Doesn't matter that
I'm completely innocent.

660
00:26:25,081 --> 00:26:27,598
I'm never gonna get that job.

661
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,349
Sorry. Are you done?

662
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:31,702
Every time you say "innocent,"
I... I tune out.

663
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:33,938
In that case, I'm just going to have
to prove it to you, aren't I?

664
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,374
Miles Durham, the first
of these so-called murders.

665
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,076
He disappeared
during a camping trip.

666
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:40,578
August 2003, right?

667
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,581
He left August 7...

668
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:47,585
He was supposed
to return August 9.

669
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,421
What is this?
Medical records. Mine.

670
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:53,591
I had elective surgery,
August 6, 2003.

671
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:55,476
There were, uh...

672
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:56,927
complications.

673
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,880
I wasn't released
until August 12.

674
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:01,548
Liposuction.
Rhytidoplasty.

675
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,384
You had a face-lift.

676
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:06,186
You see many jowly men on the
cover of Barron's, Mr. Holmes?

677
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:08,956
My point is, I couldn't have
murdered Miles Durham.

678
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:10,841
And I'll tell you
something else.

679
00:27:10,843 --> 00:27:14,778
Dan Cho--
arrogant little pissant--

680
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,498
no, he didn't work
for Canon-Ebersole in 2003,

681
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,833
because he had a summer
internship with us

682
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:21,702
while he was in business school.

683
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:23,287
Worked at our Denver office.

684
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:25,339
Here's his file.

685
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:29,009
We hired him in 2005,
sent him to Dallas.

686
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:31,244
You think there's a sociopath
working for us?

687
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:34,414
Let me let you in on
a little secret, Mr. Holmes.

688
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,417
We're all sociopaths.

689
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:42,906
Hey.

690
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:46,060
Hey, I'm trying to
read up there.

691
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:47,277
This doesn't make any sense.

692
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,380
Yes, Dan Cho
interned in Denver

693
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,031
during the summer of 2003.

694
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,067
But he didn't benefit
from the first murder.

695
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:55,369
Company didn't even hire him
till two years later.

696
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:56,954
First of all,
you're not even sure

697
00:27:56,956 --> 00:27:58,305
Miles Durham's
disappearance was a murder.

698
00:27:58,307 --> 00:27:59,540
Okay, let's say it was.

699
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:00,941
Maybe this guy Dan Cho

700
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:02,710
killed him to get
a charge out of it.

701
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:04,778
The-the murder was the benefit.

702
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,080
People who enjoy killing

703
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:07,881
like to share their
enthusiasm with others.

704
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:10,584
They want everyone to know
there's a murderer out there.

705
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:12,503
And anyway, even after
he was hired,

706
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:14,171
he didn't benefit
from the deaths

707
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:15,839
nearly as much as Jim Fowkes.

708
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,092
But Jim Fowkes...

709
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:20,060
Jim Fowkes didn't
do the first one!

710
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:21,645
It would appear not!

711
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:25,933
Marrying man?

712
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:27,184
He just won't quit.

713
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:28,635
He says he is married,

714
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:30,671
but he wants to meet me
to explain himself.

715
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:32,406
You should go.
Coffee with a creep?

716
00:28:32,408 --> 00:28:34,174
No, thanks.
If nothing else,

717
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,543
it would be an interesting
experiment in deduction for you.

718
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:37,811
Spot the lie.

719
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:39,413
Besides...

720
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:41,031
I need time to think,

721
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:43,600
which means it's not gonna
get any quieter around here.

722
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:46,203
I...

723
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:59,216
Donna.

724
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:00,718
Can I get you something?

725
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,303
I'm good.

726
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:07,274
How did you find
out I'm married?

727
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:09,727
Um... I thought you
wanted to explain yourself,

728
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:11,361
not the other way around.
Okay, wait.

729
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:13,580
I did lie to you.

730
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:15,182
I did.

731
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,568
But it's not what you think.

732
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,903
I volunteer, uh,

733
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:22,489
for a place called
Shoreline Community Services.

734
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:24,241
It's a legal aid thing.

735
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:27,494
We... work with people who are
seeking political asylum.

736
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:28,846
A while back,

737
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,131
I helped out with
a woman from Kosovo.

738
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,333
Her father was a
general in the war,

739
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,169
for the losing side,

740
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:38,589
and when it ended, he
was shot in the street.

741
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:41,225
She would have been killed
had she returned home.

742
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:43,877
But the U.S. wouldn't
give her asylum.

743
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:49,016
So you married her
to keep her in the country.

744
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:50,851
Do you have a relationship?

745
00:29:50,853 --> 00:29:52,319
Mm...

746
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:54,221
She lives in Hoboken.

747
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:57,775
I check in on her
sometimes. That's it.

748
00:29:57,777 --> 00:29:59,893
We can get a divorce in a year,

749
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:02,229
without the government
crawling all over us.

750
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,617
I would have told
you eventually,

751
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,152
if there was an "eventually""

752
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,821
But, uh...

753
00:30:10,823 --> 00:30:14,057
but now I'm just... I'm sorry.

754
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:18,812
Helping her was a really
compassionate thing to do.

755
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:21,414
Thank you.

756
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:24,718
But if you don't mind my asking,
how did you find out about it?

757
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,557
Excuse me.

758
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,059
Donna?

759
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:34,061
It is Donna, right?

760
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:37,931
No one ever remembers the
secretary, do they, Donna?

761
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,449
Excuse me, what?

762
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,652
As a career choice,
has its limits.

763
00:30:41,654 --> 00:30:44,905
But then it does afford one a
certain cloak of invisibility.

764
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:46,957
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

765
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,942
But I'm pretty sure
that Mr. Fowkes

766
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:50,944
had you banned
from the building.

767
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:52,913
You've been with him
a long time, haven't you?

768
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:54,748
Until tonight,
I just assumed that you'd...

769
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,050
come to work with him
after he moved to New York.

770
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:59,452
Then I saw your name
as the emergency contact

771
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:01,889
for a surgical procedure
he had in Denver.

772
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:05,142
You followed him to Dallas, too,
didn't you?

773
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:07,895
Mr. Fowkes is a good boss,
and we're loyal to each other.

774
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:09,796
He's certainly had
a meteoric rise.

775
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:13,433
And he probably owes some of
that to you, doesn't he, Donna?

776
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:16,737
Jim Fowkes wasn't
the only one to benefit

777
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:19,573
from the deaths
at Canon-Ebersole, was he?

778
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,191
Do I need to call security?

779
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,910
By all means. Hmm.
Let's loop them

780
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:24,077
into the conversation.

781
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:28,365
No?

782
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,367
Didn't think so.

783
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:35,655
Quite obvious when you look
at it in the proper light.

784
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:38,292
Every time Jim got promoted,
you had something to gain.

785
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,260
Pay raise,
stock options.

786
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:43,046
The company even contributes
to your retirement plan now.

787
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:45,465
So? I've given them
years of my life.

788
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:46,967
Must be quite
a feeling--

789
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:48,886
steering the fate
of a giant company

790
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:50,537
from your tiny
little cubicle.

791
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,505
Get away from me.

792
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:55,642
Question is did your boss know
or were you working alone?

793
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:58,245
If you collaborated, it would
behoove you to start talking.

794
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:01,214
First one to tattle gets
the shortest sentence.

795
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:03,817
I've seen executives
like you come and go.

796
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:06,686
A little bit of smarts,
a whole lot of ego.

797
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,538
Take my word, you've never
seen anyone like me.

798
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,792
Oh, sure, I have.
My bosses use $5,000 suits

799
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,377
to get attention.

800
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:15,195
You use a scarf and
an old T-shirt.

801
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:17,214
You're so proud
of yourself

802
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:18,715
for what you think
you discovered,

803
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,367
you just couldn't
wait to tell me.

804
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:22,219
Even if it meant
following me into an empty

805
00:32:22,221 --> 00:32:23,754
parking garage.

806
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:49,339
You're awake.

807
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:50,724
Good.

808
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:52,675
Yeah, I've pursued
my fair share of...

809
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:54,194
killers, Miss Kaplan.

810
00:32:54,196 --> 00:32:56,513
Most of them... most of them
are dreary people, but you

811
00:32:56,515 --> 00:32:59,483
I-I've a certain fascination
with. You, uh...

812
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:02,152
Such initiative.

813
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,537
Such patience.

814
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,372
I don't think
this is gonna work out

815
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:08,191
for you though.
Too rash.

816
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:09,793
Did you tell anyone about me?

817
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:11,745
Or did you just
rush right down to grandstand?

818
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:14,364
Oh, I e-mailed several colleagues...
No, you didn't.

819
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:15,999
We're gonna be
at Mr. Fowkes'

820
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,968
country estate in a
couple of minutes.

821
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,255
In a week or two, after somebody
calls in an anonymous tip,

822
00:33:22,257 --> 00:33:23,873
the police are going to find

823
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,393
your body buried
on the property.

824
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:28,178
And then everyone will know
that you were right

825
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,399
and that Mr. Fowkes killed
you before you could prove it.

826
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:34,234
You're gonna frame your boss.

827
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:37,187
Daniel Cho is gonna
get that promotion.

828
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,524
I imagine he'll need an
experienced executive secretary

829
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:42,993
to watch his back
as he rises to the top.

830
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:45,245
Hmm, I was
wrong about you.

831
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:47,414
You are smart.

832
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,583
Oh, that's quite a compliment
coming from you.

833
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:52,669
Canon-Ebersole should make you
the managing director.

834
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:56,072
They don't have the imagination
for that kind of move.

835
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:02,879
"Joan." That's the woman that
you're always with, right?

836
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:06,049
That's the fifth time she texted
in the last 20 minutes.

837
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:07,434
She won't stop, you know.

838
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:09,419
Very high-strung.

839
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:11,688
I wouldn't be surprised
if she gets the police involved.

840
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,690
Well, in that case,
we should let her know

841
00:34:13,692 --> 00:34:16,626
that everything's okay.

842
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:19,696
I'm a sober companion.

843
00:34:19,698 --> 00:34:21,565
I work with recovering
drug addicts.

844
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,899
Sherlock is my client.

845
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:24,951
His father hired me
to help him stay clean.

846
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:27,237
The only reason
I am telling you this

847
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,588
is because I think
he may have relapsed.

848
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,407
I need your help to find him.

849
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,108
What makes you
think he relapsed?

850
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,944
The heroin from the crime scene
the other day.

851
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:36,129
It affected him.

852
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:38,281
I think it brought
some things back.

853
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,221
It's Sherlock.

854
00:34:44,223 --> 00:34:46,806
He says he's fine,
he's heading back.

855
00:34:46,808 --> 00:34:49,125
See? There you go.

856
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:50,527
Nothing to
worry about.

857
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:52,429
"See you soon."

858
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:55,332
No, seriously?

859
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:57,701
You honestly expect me
to dig my own grave?

860
00:34:57,703 --> 00:34:59,803
Have you ever
been gut-shot?

861
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:03,773
No. I imagine it makes it
difficult to do manual labor.

862
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:06,476
Shoot me, yank my fingernails
out-- the answer's still no.

863
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:08,211
I categorically refuse
to dig a hole for you

864
00:35:08,213 --> 00:35:09,412
to bury me in, sorry.

865
00:35:09,414 --> 00:35:11,248
Fine.

866
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,283
I'll do it myself.

867
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,784
It's not supposed
to be that deep.

868
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:17,654
They're supposed
to find you.

869
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,623
Tell me something.

870
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,691
How did you get started
with all this?

871
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:24,694
You must be very proud
of your projects.

872
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:28,098
It must kill you to have to
keep it all to yourself, hmm?

873
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,301
I-I'm about to die, so
now's your chance to share.

874
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:34,838
Good to share, yeah.

875
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,506
Tell me.

876
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:39,109
What launched the career
of Donna Kaplan,

877
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:40,610
corporate sociopath?

878
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:43,013
Mr. Fowkes was a bonds salesman
back in Denver,

879
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,615
the company was downsizing.

880
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:47,550
They were either going
to cut his job...

881
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,954
What are they doing here?

882
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:53,156
I'm not really sure.

883
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:55,024
Bought me some
time, though.

884
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:56,710
Did you know I pick locks?

885
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:59,045
Pockets, too.

886
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:09,589
I can't take a tranquilizer, but
if it's not too much trouble,

887
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:12,192
I'd love ten minutes
hooked up to your oxygen rig.

888
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:16,879
I'll just help myself then.

889
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:19,566
There's plenty of oxygen
out here, you know.

890
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,484
Pure stuff's better.

891
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:23,320
It invigorates and restores.

892
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:25,572
Haven't you heard?
I've been through a trauma.

893
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:31,494
That was, uh, very convenient

894
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:34,114
the local police showing up
when they did.

895
00:36:34,116 --> 00:36:36,899
Too convenient
to be a coincidence.

896
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,369
It was the text message
that Donna sent

897
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:40,620
from my phone, wasn't it?

898
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:43,256
"Everything's fine.
Phone was off.

899
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:45,759
My mistake. See you soon."
That's it.

900
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:48,578
No emoticons,
no indecipherable acronyms.

901
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,965
It didn't read
like a teenager on a sugar high.

902
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:54,134
Which meant you didn't write it.

903
00:36:54,136 --> 00:36:56,886
I manipulated her
into writing it for me.

904
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:59,139
I knew she'd never be able
to duplicate my flair

905
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:01,891
for our evolving mother tongue.

906
00:37:01,893 --> 00:37:04,711
I also knew...
I-I hoped

907
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:06,763
that once you realized
the message wasn't from me,

908
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:09,949
you'd know I was in trouble.

909
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,902
From there, it's relatively
simple for the police

910
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:15,488
to run a cellular interceptor
on my phone,

911
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,490
find my location, quick call
to the local authorities...

912
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:19,275
I'm sorry, are you trying
to take credit

913
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:21,161
for the fact
that I saved your life?

914
00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:25,498
And so soon after you
promoted me to bodyguard.

915
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,550
It was a
collaboration.

916
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:30,470
Well done, Watson.

917
00:37:32,623 --> 00:37:36,393
Your deductive skills are not
unworthy of further development.

918
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:40,797
I think that was a compliment,
buried in a double negative,

919
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:43,132
so... thanks.

920
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:44,901
Detective?

921
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:48,605
Look, you should know,

922
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:51,241
I went to Captain Gregson
when I couldn't find you.

923
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:53,309
I had to...

924
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:56,446
explain some things to him.

925
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:03,203
I'm sorry.

926
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:08,208
You might want to have a talk
with him.

927
00:38:16,218 --> 00:38:18,134
Come in.

928
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,611
You know...

929
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:30,313
You were busy
at Jim Fowkes' house,

930
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:32,882
and I didn't get a chance
to pull you aside.

931
00:38:32,884 --> 00:38:36,486
But I didn't want to let more
time pass without having a word.

932
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,188
We have something to talk about?

933
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,376
There are any number of reasons

934
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:46,028
why I didn't tell you
about my history.

935
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,532
Um... I've told myself dozens,

936
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:53,002
all of them specious.

937
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,977
In the end, um,
it... it is simple.

938
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:03,680
Uh, I was... I was...
I was embarrassed.

939
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:10,353
Since we first collaborated,

940
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:13,439
you've always held me
and my work in a certain esteem.

941
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:19,412
I guess I'm-I'm... I'm, uh...
I'm m-more vain about that

942
00:39:19,414 --> 00:39:22,064
than I would care to admit.

943
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:27,036
So, I'm sorry, 'cause you...

944
00:39:27,038 --> 00:39:29,589
you deserved to know.

945
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:31,574
I did know.

946
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:33,343
I beg your pardon?

947
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:35,795
Do you honestly think
I'd let you consult

948
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:38,915
for the NYPD
without doing my homework?

949
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:42,552
You told me Joan was
your personal valet.

950
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:45,104
Do you think I'm an idiot?

951
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:47,423
No.

952
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:49,359
You are above average
in intelligence.

953
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:52,595
And for a policeman,
I would say, top tier.

954
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:55,398
I've known about your
problem for a while now.

955
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,133
Why didn't you say anything?

956
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:59,469
I did, sort of.

957
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:02,071
A while back,
I asked you out for a drink.

958
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:04,641
You said, "No""

959
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,309
I figured you'd talk about it

960
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:08,745
when you were ready
to talk about it.

961
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:11,514
Was I happy
that you didn't tell me?

962
00:40:11,516 --> 00:40:14,117
No.

963
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:23,459
But your work hasn't slipped
one bit since Scotland Yard.

964
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:28,731
Thank you.

965
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:31,568
Well, not everyone

966
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,803
is gonna see it
my way, so,

967
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:36,272
I'm gonna do us both a favor

968
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:39,342
and keep a lid on this.

969
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:05,718
Unbelievable.

970
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,054
What is?

971
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:10,690
It's just that green
card marriage guy.

972
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:12,859
Emily's having this dinner party
thing next week,

973
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,311
and we talked
about maybe going together,

974
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:17,780
and I think now
he's blowing me off.

975
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:20,349
But you know what
the irony is?

976
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:23,620
I don't even want to be in a
relationship right now. I...

977
00:41:23,622 --> 00:41:25,989
It's just that Emily
went to so much trouble.

978
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:29,025
Yet his apparent
mutual disinterest irks you.

979
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:31,794
It's crazy, I know.

980
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:36,198
If I had to guess, and by
sitting there talking about it--

981
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
you're forcing me to--
I would say

982
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:40,553
he finds your analytical
skills intimidating.

983
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:42,005
He was a little weirded out

984
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,173
when I told him
I looked him up online,

985
00:41:44,175 --> 00:41:46,976
but he lied about being married,
so we are square, right?

986
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:49,779
He might not see it that way.
Doesn't, apparently.

987
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:54,216
It has its costs.

988
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:56,319
What does?

989
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:59,388
Learning to see the puzzle
in everything.

990
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,574
They're everywhere.

991
00:42:01,576 --> 00:42:04,861
Once you start looking,
it's impossible to stop.

992
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:09,332
It just so happens
that people,

993
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:11,751
and all the deceits
and delusions

994
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:14,704
that inform
everything they do,

995
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,923
tend to be the most
fascinating puzzles of all.

996
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,909
Of course,

997
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:22,745
they don't always appreciate
being seen as such.

998
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:27,750
Seems like a lonely way to live.

999
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:33,022
As I said, it has its costs.
