1
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:22,748
Too loud?

2
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:23,957
Sorry.

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,624
I went downstairs
to get some cereal.

4
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,876
Didn't want to miss anything.

5
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:29,628
This city has

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,046
excellent scanner apps,

7
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,831
but there's nothing
like the tactility

8
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,802
of the original devices--
all those dials and buttons.

9
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,688
You like pushing buttons;
I'm stunned.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,140
You've been glued to these
for the last few days.

11
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,475
It's a slow week.

12
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,394
At least in regards
to murder and mayhem.

13
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:47,195
Captain Gregson
hasn't called once.

14
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:48,613
Maybe some lunatic will

15
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,449
put his mother-in-law
in the wood chipper,

16
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,067
give you something
to do today.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,288
Uh, I need to talk
to you about something.

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,789
That's never good.

19
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,241
Your father
e-mailed me last night

20
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:00,525
before I went to bed.

21
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,526
He's coming into town
for business.

22
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,644
Wants to have dinner.

23
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:06,030
What's so funny?

24
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:06,998
Him.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,167
Dinner. Us.

26
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,535
You.

27
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,671
Remind me, Watson:
how many times

28
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,822
have you actually met the man?

29
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,507
Never.

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,808
That's because
he secured your services

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,009
as my sober companion
electronically.

32
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,261
Yeah, but...
And all of your

33
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:21,045
subsequent correspondence
has been

34
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,564
via e-mail or through one of his
legion of personal assistants.

35
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,183
- So?
- So, take it from someone

36
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,686
who has spent incrementally
more time with him than you:

37
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,188
he has zero intention of meeting
us for dinner this evening.

38
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,306
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,691
Shh!

40
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,025
...at Beach 17 Street.

41
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,811
10-4, multiple units responding.

42
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:40,365
Detective,
show me 84 at the scene, over.

43
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,066
- What is it?
- Get dressed. We're leaving.

44
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,788
Do you want to tell me
what you just heard?

45
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,541
"10-66."
Code for "unusual incident."

46
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,593
It can mean
one of only three things.

47
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:53,678
Location of the incident--
Far Rockaway Beach--

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,764
indicates it's neither
a train collision

49
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:59,151
nor a building collapse, which
leaves only one possibility.

50
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:01,720
Plane crash.

51
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,222
I didn't realize you also
investigated accidents?

52
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,108
We need to find
Captain Gregson.

53
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,258
He 84'd on
the scanner.

54
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,810
I heard his voice.

55
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,229
"84" is confirmation he
had arrived on the scene.

56
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,564
What are you doing here?

57
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,065
I heard what happened
on the scanner;

58
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,951
I thought I might be able
to be of assistance.

59
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,619
This isn't a crime scene,
it's a crash site.

60
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,070
I'm a jack-of-
many-trades.

61
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,156
When it comes to aviation
and air accidents,

62
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,441
I'm something of an expert.

63
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,627
Good to know, but we've already
got all the experts we need.

64
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,295
This is their scene, not mine.

65
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,131
Department's just here
to lend a hand.

66
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,782
Captain Gregson?

67
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,967
Yeah?

68
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,335
Some of our looky-loos
are getting

69
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:34,636
a little too
close for comfort.

70
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:35,954
Sergeant, you hear that?

71
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,121
Excuse me, Miss, uh...

72
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,757
Molinari.

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,058
What exactly
are we looking at?

74
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,593
Engine failure?
Bird strike?

75
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,127
Fatigued wing spar?

76
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,930
Ms. Molinari, uh,

77
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,231
this is, uh,
Sherlock Holmes.

78
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,649
He's a consultant
with the NYPD.

79
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,984
Miss Watson.

80
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:51,753
You have a consultant
for plane crashes?

81
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,772
No, he's...

82
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,740
A specialist in the field
of deductive reasoning.

83
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,359
And unraveling
the complex chain of events

84
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,778
that can turn a triumph
of human innovation

85
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,312
into a smoldering pile

86
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,265
of wreckage in seconds--

87
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,583
well, I can't think of

88
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,285
a more compelling
application than that.

89
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,654
Well, thank you
for the offer, Mr. Holmes,

90
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,506
but I think
we have things covered.

91
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:15,326
Go home, okay?

92
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,796
If you really need something
to do, I'll send you

93
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,098
some cold case
files when I get...

94
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,800
back to the precinct.

95
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,002
Holmes!

96
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,553
How many of the passengers
were attorneys?

97
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,571
All of them.

98
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:43,688
How did you...?

99
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,290
The toiletry kit.

100
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,908
It's emblazoned with
the logo "VeriScript."

101
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,294
That's a court reporting company

102
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,862
hired to
transcribe depositions.

103
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,080
Obviously given
to the lawyers

104
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:53,865
as some sort of
promotional gift,

105
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,250
help drum up business.

106
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,869
This man's leg was nearly

107
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,588
amputated by a piece
of fuselage,

108
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,340
yet there's virtually
no evidence of blood loss

109
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,042
on his pants.

110
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,227
Laceration like that

111
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,544
while his heart
was still pumping,

112
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,396
that'd make
quite a mess, no?

113
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:09,497
To put it mildly.

114
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,866
Blunt force trauma

115
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,601
on the back of his head.

116
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:14,386
It's a nasty one at that.

117
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,789
Someone caved his skull in
before the plane hit the ground.

118
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,526
This man didn't die
in a plane crash...

119
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,646
he was murdered.

120
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,690
â™ª Elementary 1x06 â™ª
Flight Risk
Original Air Date on November 8, 2012

121
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,691
== sync, corrected by elderman ==

122
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:38,072
Note the distinctive shape
of the wound, the depth,

123
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:41,173
the severity of damage
to the bone, gray matter.

124
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,925
The murder weapon
wasn't just heavy,

125
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:46,161
it had two prongs
at the tip.

126
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:47,162
A wrench?

127
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:49,164
Large one.

128
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,498
Blow would've
killed him instantly.

129
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,884
Has the, uh,
has the voice recorder

130
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,218
been recovered
from the cockpit?

131
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,220
Not yet.

132
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:58,273
Any eyewitness accounts
of the crash?

133
00:04:58,275 --> 00:04:59,975
One, a jogger.

134
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,977
She said that the plane
was gaining altitude

135
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,313
when the nose suddenly
went straight up.

136
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:08,650
It climbed like that for
a while, then shuddered,

137
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:10,819
tipped to the right and
went into a tailspin.

138
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:15,207
I was thinking wake turbulence
or elevator control failure.

139
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:16,491
Hmm.

140
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:17,693
Might want to add

141
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,162
"wrench-wielding
madman" to that list.

142
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:21,964
The passengers
were all attorneys

143
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,531
with the same
white shoe firm.

144
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,751
Two men, one woman.

145
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:27,502
The odds of one of them
attacking the other

146
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,504
in the back of this small
plane with a wrench...

147
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:32,057
You can see how that might be
distracting to a pilot, no?

148
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,225
Hmm?

149
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:36,261
Unless the pilot was the killer.

150
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:38,647
You're saying that the pilot
got up from his controls

151
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,215
to attack a passenger?

152
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:41,683
Drivers get road rage.

153
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,235
Can a pilot get air rage?

154
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:44,903
Would
you come with me?

155
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,105
Let's talk logistics.

156
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,244
Did you find something?

157
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:54,363
Sand.

158
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,381
Well, yeah...

159
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:59,418
th-these granules
aren't frosted.

160
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,372
Natural sand is,
um, it's smoother, weathered.

161
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:05,257
The city must have
trucked in new sand

162
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,009
to offset the erosion
on the beach.

163
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,260
Are you okay?

164
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:10,512
You seem a little off,
even for you.

165
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:12,547
Four people are dead,
Watson.

166
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,132
I'm just trying
to do my part.

167
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,101
I get it,
but whoever killed that attorney

168
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:18,036
must have died in that crash,
too, right?

169
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:19,972
Obviously.

170
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,190
Well, then if there's
no killer on the loose,

171
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:24,660
I just, I don't understand
why you're sticking around.

172
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:27,112
Because the killer
hasn't been identified yet.

173
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,530
We have three suspects.

174
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:29,815
Dead, alive, doesn't matter.

175
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,733
Two of them
are innocent of the crime.

176
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,453
Don't you think we owe it to
their loved ones to prove that?

177
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:36,204
Absolutely, but all the police
have to do

178
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:37,456
is find the murder weapon.

179
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,940
Then they can
compare fingerprints.

180
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,442
What if they don't find it?
What then?

181
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:41,576
Hmm?

182
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,462
Also, the killer
committed a murder

183
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,914
on a very small plane
with a very large wrench.

184
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,299
Now, if the crime
was spur-of-the-moment,

185
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,151
what was the wrench
doing there, hmm?

186
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:51,619
If it was premeditated,
what was the killer thinking?

187
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,088
He-- or she-- waited

188
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,906
until they were in
an extremely confined space

189
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,675
with their
would-be victim

190
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:57,909
and two witnesses. Hmm?

191
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:59,978
That seems like
a strange time and place

192
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,813
to commit a violent homicide,

193
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,231
wouldn't you agree?

194
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,816
It's just...

195
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:06,435
there's a story here, Watson.

196
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:08,020
And we can help tell it.

197
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,105
Or do we just need
to stay busy enough

198
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:11,973
to miss dinner with your father?

199
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:15,177
So, CSU's en route
to process the scene.

200
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,430
NTSB will work their crash,
and we'll work our murder.

201
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:20,315
If I may make a suggestion,
Captain.

202
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,867
We start by
speaking with the people

203
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,086
who were the last
to have seen the victims alive.

204
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,004
Good idea.

205
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,706
Joe and I were

206
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,376
friends for over 20 years.

207
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,729
This would be Joe
Newell, the pilot?

208
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,180
Yeah.

209
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:38,433
Were you very familiar
with the passengers?

210
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:40,852
Walter Devlin flew with us
quite a bit.

211
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:43,305
But that was
mostly for cases

212
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:45,173
that he or his law firm
were taking on.

213
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:47,275
What about his associates?

214
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:48,843
Uh, Hank Gerrard
and Ellie Wilson?

215
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,946
Yeah, they accompanied him
once or twice,

216
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,981
but I never
actually met them.

217
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,850
You weren't at the airstrip when
the plane took off this morning?

218
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:56,818
I own the company,
I don't fly the planes.

219
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,703
So I'm not always there
when they take off.

220
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:02,357
Your friend, Joe-- was
he an irascible type?

221
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,426
Short-tempered?
No.

222
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,627
He's ex-military.

223
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:06,828
Joe didn't have a temper.

224
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,747
We have reason to believe

225
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,016
that there was an incident
shortly after takeoff.

226
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:14,519
Uh, Hank Gerrard may
have been attacked.

227
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,004
I don't understand.
And you think that's

228
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:17,456
what might have
brought down the plane?

229
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,840
We're waiting
for the NTSB

230
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:20,842
to make their
official report.

231
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,045
Look, I don't know
how much help it'd be,

232
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,815
but we put a security camera
in the parking area last year

233
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,483
after a couple cars
were broken into.

234
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:30,735
You might be able to see
the passengers arriving.

235
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,687
We'll take it, definitely.

236
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:34,489
But as far as Joe goes,

237
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:38,059
all I can tell you is he was
as good a man as he was a pilot,

238
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,145
and he never had one problem
with any passenger.

239
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:43,281
So, if Mr. Gerrard
was attacked,

240
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:45,617
Joe wasn't the guy who did it.

241
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:47,402
Learn anything?

242
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,405
Only that the pilot's boss
thought very highly of him.

243
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:54,025
Doesn't mean he didn't go mental
on a passenger, mind you.

244
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:56,744
I just got an e-mail from
your dad's personal secretary.

245
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,246
Ah, told you he'd back out.

246
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:59,747
Actually, he
was wondering

247
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,950
if we could do dinner
at Lure at 6:00.

248
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:04,886
Look, I know you
have your issues,

249
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,004
but I think it's
important that we go.

250
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:07,088
Of course you do.

251
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,190
He's signing your checks.

252
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:09,441
Remind me,
how are you

253
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:10,826
paying for the
brownstone again?

254
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,563
He obviously
cares about you.

255
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:16,781
If he didn't, he would not
have put you through rehab

256
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:19,317
and he certainly would not have
hired me to work with you.

257
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,903
I'm about to disabuse you
of several notions,

258
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,405
so please listen very carefully.

259
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,157
One: my father
does not care about me.

260
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,826
He does what he does out of
a sense of familial obligations.

261
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:28,860
Big difference.

262
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,645
Two: he does not
care about you

263
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:31,880
or what you think.

264
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:33,448
Meeting you would be
a formality.

265
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,300
And three:
as I've already told you,

266
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:37,002
your concern is unwarranted,
'cause he has absolutely

267
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,470
no intention
of showing up tonight.

268
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,605
How could you
possibly know that?

269
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,340
Because he is a serial absentee.

270
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:45,594
A pathological maker
and breaker of promises.

271
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:47,429
Been that way since I was a boy.

272
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:48,897
Fool me once, shame on you.

273
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,265
Fool me ad nauseam...

274
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:51,483
Holmes.

275
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:53,568
Got something for you
and the captain.

276
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,354
Captain, just got
off the phone with

277
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:59,140
one of the junior partners
at Walter Devlin's firm.

278
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:01,293
He said that Devlin, Hank
Gerrard and Ellie Wilson

279
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:03,411
were headed to a retreat in
Martha's Vineyard to work on

280
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:06,665
a class action case against a
company called Carmanto Foods.

281
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,266
There were allegations
that the company's

282
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:09,484
sugar substitute causes cancer.

283
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:10,785
Plaintiffs were seeking damages

284
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:12,504
in the neighborhood
of a hundred mil.

285
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,089
Seems there was a
lot of infighting

286
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,424
among our three dead lawyers
about how to proceed.

287
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:19,411
Anyone particularly angry with
the murder victim, Hank Gerrard?

288
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:20,629
As a matter of fact, yeah.

289
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:22,097
He was butting heads
with his boss,

290
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,815
Walter Devlin.

291
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:24,999
Devlin's inclination
was to settle,

292
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,518
Gerrard's was to
keep fighting.

293
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,220
They'd had a few loud
arguments at the office.

294
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,222
Guy I spoke to thought
Gerrard was gonna get fired

295
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:31,740
if he didn't
back down.

296
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,008
Sounds like we've got
our primary suspect.

297
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,511
Still doesn't explain why the
head of a successful law firm

298
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,597
would've brought a wrench
aboard a small aircraft.

299
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,031
It's possible

300
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,199
we're about to find out.

301
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,685
Ms. Molinari of the NTSB.

302
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,987
They just found
the plane's black box.

303
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:53,161
Key Star two eight three
hotel foxtrot,

304
00:10:53,163 --> 00:10:54,162
state your position.

305
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:55,863
Air traffic control.

306
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,882
Key Star two eight three
hotel foxtrot...

307
00:10:57,884 --> 00:10:59,200
That's the pilot, Joe Newell.

308
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:00,418
...endurance 90 minutes.

309
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,803
Thank you, Key Star.

310
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:03,138
You're clear to climb to 3,400.

311
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,556
I made you, Hank.

312
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:06,174
Took you in and built you up
from nothing.

313
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:07,926
And now you pull
a stunt like this?

314
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:11,313
You think I'm gonna let it
slide? Guess again.

315
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:13,265
Calm down, Walter.

316
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,717
Walter Devlin,
Ellie Wilson.

317
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:18,320
Let the pilot do his job.
Come back here, we'll do ours.

318
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:20,272
Key Star to ATC,
what's my best vector?

319
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:21,906
You cannot protect Hank,
Ellie; not from me.

320
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,695
What the hell, what the hell's
going on back there?!

321
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,780
Damn! Get it down.
Get it down! What is it?!

322
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:31,583
Key Star to ATC,
we have an emergency. Oh, God.

323
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:36,087
ATC to Key Star:
Are you able to maintain altitude?

324
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,255
That's a negative.

325
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:42,310
Brace! Brace!

326
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:47,332
I can't believe it, but it
sounds like you were right.

327
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:50,385
No, I was mistaken.
There wasn't any fight.

328
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,919
But you can hear...

329
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,688
An entirely one-sided argument.

330
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,056
Mr. Gerrard
never says a word.

331
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,025
But the junior partner
that you spoke with

332
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:59,511
said that he and Devlin were
prone to loud disagreements.

333
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:01,613
Yet this morning, Hank Gerrard
doesn't even get

334
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:03,214
a syllable in edgeways.
Also I'm assuming

335
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,532
that if your people
had found

336
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:07,068
a murder weapon by now,
you would have told us.

337
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,203
It seems strange,
given that

338
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,372
every other
piece of debris

339
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:11,690
seems to have
been accounted for.

340
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,107
Could've ended up in
the water.

341
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:14,876
Well, nothing else seemed to.

342
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:16,778
Okay, how do you explain
the pilot's initial exchange

343
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,213
with air traffic control?

344
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,081
He says, and I quote,
"Three souls aboard."

345
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,333
Three. Not four.

346
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:23,752
He could have meant
three passengers.

347
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,620
Pilots often don't include
themselves in the count.

348
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,572
I believe this one did.
What are you saying?

349
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:30,992
That he didn't know Hank Gerrard
was in the cabin?

350
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:33,294
I'm saying Hank Gerrard
wasn't in the cabin.

351
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,563
But that's impossible.
His body was in the wreckage.

352
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:36,931
Allow me, if you will,

353
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,433
another interpretation
of the evidence.

354
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:41,302
Hank Gerrard wasn't
killed on the plane,

355
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:44,105
he was killed elsewhere, and
earlier in the morning.

356
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:46,608
It would explain why the
wrench hasn't turned up,

357
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,142
'cause it wasn't on
the plane.

358
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:50,445
Because the crime scene,
crash site,

359
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:53,581
two entirely
different places, hmm?

360
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,266
The killer bludgeoned

361
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,202
Mr. Gerrard, then, for reasons

362
00:12:57,204 --> 00:13:00,555
yet to be determined,
conceals his body in the cargo hold.

363
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:02,290
Mr. Devlin, he just assumes

364
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,342
that Gerrard has missed
the flight,

365
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:06,244
so he calls his absentee
colleague

366
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:07,962
to scold him.

367
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:09,714
That's would explain why

368
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:11,549
you don't hear Gerrard's
voice on the recording,

369
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,051
'cause Devlin's tirade
was a voice message.

370
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,169
Now Ms. Wilson, she tries
to calm Devlin.

371
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:16,471
She leads him
towards the back

372
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,172
of the plane.

373
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,357
Now, neither of them knows
there's a 200-pound corpse

374
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,126
just inches below
their feet.

375
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:23,678
The sudden weight imbalance
threw the plane into a dive.

376
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,030
Did you recover Mr.
Gerrard's cell phone?

377
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:28,182
Yes, but it's damaged.

378
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:37,659
May I?

379
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:43,531
If I'm right...

380
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:46,334
he'll have a new voicemail.

381
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:47,802
I made you, Hank.

382
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:50,004
Took you in
and built you up from nothing.

383
00:13:50,006 --> 00:13:51,539
Now you pull a stunt like this?

384
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:55,226
You think I'm gonna let it
slide? Guess again.

385
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:57,545
Mr. Devlin and Ms. Wilson did
not kill Hank Gerrard;

386
00:13:57,547 --> 00:13:59,230
they didn't even
know where he was.

387
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:02,784
Joe Newell,
an experienced pilot,

388
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:04,769
would've known better than
to stash the extra weight

389
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:07,322
of his body in the cargo hold
and risk exactly

390
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,056
the kind of
accident that occurred.

391
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,525
They may be dead,

392
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:13,661
but the person who killed
Hank Gerrard is not.

393
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:16,748
We have a living, breathing
murderer to find after all.

394
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:27,339
What was the killer thinking?
Why stuff Gerrard's body

395
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,940
in the hold of the plane,
like so much luggage?

396
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:31,642
Surely he knew it
would be discovered

397
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:33,477
when the plane
reached Martha's Vineyard.

398
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,313
Did he want it found?
If yes, why?

399
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,949
Was it intended
as some sort of message?

400
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,284
If so, to whom?

401
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:42,453
Can I ask you a question?

402
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:44,088
Can I stop you?

403
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,140
Are you afraid of flying?

404
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,560
It's just you
pursuing this case

405
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:51,228
didn't make sense
to me at first.

406
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,447
As far as you knew,
it was just an accident.

407
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,515
But then at the
crash site this morning,

408
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:56,800
you weren't yourself.

409
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:58,118
"Myself"?

410
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,804
You got distracted
by sand on a beach.

411
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:02,823
And look at that board.

412
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,625
Normally, you would
have put up every picture

413
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,160
you had from the
crash site.

414
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,661
But instead, there's
just images of what

415
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:09,046
the plane used to
look like.

416
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:10,364
I've already examined
those pictures,

417
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:11,832
and they yielded nothing.

418
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,300
Now since you're
a disgraced ex-surgeon

419
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:14,752
and not a disgraced
ex-psychologist,

420
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:17,338
what say you stop
analyzing me, okay?

421
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,890
How did you get
from London to New York?

422
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:26,130
Okay, well, maybe your father
will tell me at dinner tonight.

423
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:27,064
Hey.

424
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,849
Just got the phone
with the owner

425
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:30,401
of Key Star Charters,
Charles Cooper.

426
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:32,386
They got the footage from
their security camera.

427
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,721
He said there's something on it
we should see.

428
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:42,613
So, this is about 45 minutes
before the plane took off.

429
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:44,581
That's Mr. Gerrard.

430
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,634
I don't know who
this other guy is, but

431
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,987
obviously, he and Mr. Gerrard
had words.

432
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,589
It's the model glue,
isn't it?

433
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:54,708
It's murder on my senses.

434
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,744
Not to mention I'm under
strict orders not to get high.

435
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,880
This office is like
one big huffing bag.

436
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:01,849
Ten minutes later,
he leaves alone.

437
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:05,519
So now we know Mr. Gerrard
arrived here alive and intact.

438
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:07,271
Gotta figure he was
killed here, too.

439
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:09,023
You got this from any
other angles?

440
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:12,559
Eh, sorry. Only other camera
got broke a few weeks ago.

441
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:13,927
Hasn't been fixed yet.

442
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,779
Mr. Cooper, I'm gonna
need you and Mister...

443
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:17,898
Barts.
...Barts to clear out of here for a while.

444
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,733
Meantime, we'll get
this video to our experts,

445
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:22,319
see if we can't
identify our mystery man.

446
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,379
Any luck cleaning up
that picture?

447
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:35,132
About as much luck as I had
examining the hangar.

448
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:37,051
No sign of any crime being
perpetrated there.

449
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:38,502
No clarity with regards

450
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:40,254
to our fat friend's
facial features here.

451
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:43,123
On the bright side, I think
I might know where he works.

452
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:46,343
"Arm To?"

453
00:16:48,897 --> 00:16:50,731
Carmanto Foods--
isn't that the company

454
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,816
that Gerrard and his colleagues
were suing, right?

455
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:55,069
Almost anyone who works there
would've had motive.

456
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:57,404
Unfortunately, rotund
white male executives

457
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:00,474
at the company number
in the dozens.

458
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,659
Our suspect does have one
distinguishing feature, however:

459
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,662
the '90s-era "pager"
attached to his belt.

460
00:17:05,664 --> 00:17:08,332
I'm gonna go get started
getting ready to meet your dad.

461
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,117
Last chance
to join us for dinner?

462
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,152
Last chance to accept
there is no dinner.

463
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,987
Dad... never... shows!

464
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:15,172
Say it with me, Watson.

465
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,007
Maybe it'll sink in.
Sherlock...

466
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,292
He's Lucy with the football.

467
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:19,993
You're Charlie Brown.

468
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,229
People don't make plans
just to break them.

469
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:24,014
People don't. My father does.

470
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,185
For the record,
that's not a pager.

471
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:31,221
It's an insulin pump.
Your mystery man is a diabetic.

472
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:37,161
Ed Hairston?

473
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:39,279
Detective Bell, NYPD.

474
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:41,448
This is my colleague
Mr. Holmes.

475
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,283
We'd like to ask you
some questions

476
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,868
about your relationship
with Hank Gerrard.

477
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,621
I'm sorry... I don't know
who that is.

478
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:50,791
Odd. His firm is suing
your company for $100 million.

479
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:53,477
Something about a sugar
substitute that causes cancer.

480
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,678
We have surveillance
video of you

481
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,581
talking to Mr. Gerrard
in the Key Star Charters

482
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,800
parking lot shortly before
someone caved his skull in,

483
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,835
stuck him in the hold
of a small plane.

484
00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:03,170
It's how we found
you, actually.

485
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,038
Saw the Carmanto logo
on your shirt,

486
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,057
insulin pump on your
belt, made a few calls.

487
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,642
It's a bit ironic,
isn't it?

488
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:11,411
Diabetic working for a company
that makes bad sugar?

489
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:12,896
I don't understand.

490
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:14,898
I heard on the news
Hank was killed in a crash.

491
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,251
This would be the same Hank
you don't know?

492
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,057
I did know him, sort of.

493
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,293
I was helping him.

494
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:28,795
By showing his scalp what the
inside of his skull looked like?

495
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:31,081
It happened with his case.

496
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,383
I'd been giving him
information

497
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:35,085
to use against Carmanto.

498
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:36,703
You're a whistleblower?

499
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:39,923
Hank was angry with me
because I refused to testify.

500
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:42,709
Carmanto had offered
a settlement.

501
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:44,845
I thought it was more
than fair.

502
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,413
Hank's boss was inclined

503
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:50,083
to accept it,
and Hank wanted more.

504
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,351
He...

505
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:53,637
He asked me yesterday
to reconsider taking the stand.

506
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:54,771
I told him I couldn't.

507
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:56,723
We argued.
I left.

508
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:59,259
I never laid a hand on him.

509
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:03,397
The company knew that
that sugar substitute was deadly.

510
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,765
And Carmanto buried
that evidence,

511
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,701
convinced everybody
it was fine.

512
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:10,103
It looked like sugar,
it felt like sugar...

513
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,838
but it wasn't.

514
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,041
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Hairston; we'll be in touch.

515
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,293
Thought you said that guy was our
strongest suspect.

516
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:17,828
Now that I've met him,

517
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,613
I know that he's our
weakest suspect, literally.

518
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:21,081
Did you see how hard
it was for him

519
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,717
to open that pill bottle?
So?

520
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,252
Type-2 diabetes can
significantly affect

521
00:19:25,254 --> 00:19:27,287
grip strength,
particularly in men.

522
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,006
His is so bad

523
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,957
he's bought adaptive office
supplies:

524
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,843
oversized ergonomic pens,
a book holder.

525
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,794
There's no way could he have
grasped and swung

526
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,563
the heavy wrench used
to kill Hank Gerrard.

527
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,682
So, in other words,
we got nothing.

528
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:40,634
Nope. We've got sand.

529
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:41,818
Thank you.

530
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,104
Mr. Holmes?

531
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:46,323
Ms. Watson, I presume.

532
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,991
You're early.

533
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:50,594
Not as early as you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

534
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:52,112
Oh!
Oh...

535
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:54,081
Uh, Zadie Smith is one
of my favorite authors.

536
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,618
my son is parking the car.

537
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,919
Um...

538
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,254
No, it's okay,
Ms. Watson.

539
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,988
No need for excuses.
The truth is

540
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,177
I'd have been much more
surprised if he had come.

541
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,681
I've laid as many bricks in
the wall between us as he has.

542
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:13,850
So, how's the old boy doing?

543
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,602
Good, actually.

544
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,888
I think he's got a handle
on his post-rehab life.

545
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,474
I mean, he doesn't keep
the healthiest hours,

546
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:23,310
but you know, work keeps
him busy, focused.

547
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:25,362
Getting him to go to
support group meetings

548
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:27,147
can be tricky, though.

549
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,682
Stubborn, criminally so.

550
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:29,716
Always was.

551
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,519
I remember when he was a boy,

552
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,987
he'd climb the fence

553
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:36,323
around our property
and walk from post to post.

554
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:40,711
I warned him it was dangerous,
but he wouldn't listen.

555
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:43,747
Then he falls and
lands on his wrist.

556
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:46,083
Ugly business,
bone jutting through skin.

557
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,986
But despite the pain,

558
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,672
he set the bone
and wrapped the wound himself.

559
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:57,511
Took to wearing long-sleeve
shirts for the next few days.

560
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:00,597
All to keep his father from
telling him that he was right.

561
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,732
You're kidding me.

562
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:04,184
Ended up with a scar right here.

563
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:08,071
Covered it with one of his barmy
tattoos, if memory serves.

564
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:10,440
I am really glad
we're doing this.

565
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:12,693
Oh?
I've had many different clients,

566
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:16,396
but Sherlock is
definitely... unique.

567
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:19,783
The's er just so much more
I want know about him.

568
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:22,419
I'm happy to answer any
questions you may have.

569
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:25,255
Would you mind terribly
if I asked one of you first?

570
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:27,424
How's the sex?

571
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:29,676
I beg your pardon?

572
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:31,745
The sex. The shagging.

573
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:33,913
Is he enjoying it?

574
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:36,133
I don't understand.

575
00:21:36,135 --> 00:21:39,770
I was told that was part of
the "service" you provided.

576
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:42,606
Satisfying your client's
every need.

577
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,958
Why else would anyone pay
your exorbitant fees?

578
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,811
You're not Mr. Holmes, are you?

579
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:57,237
I don't believe this.

580
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,823
I'm sorry, it's just...

581
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:02,376
if you'd seen your face...

582
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:03,777
Who are you?

583
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:04,828
Actor.

584
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,247
Well, a struggling one at that.

585
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:08,799
Your Mr. Sherlock

586
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:10,167
hired me from
my manager.

587
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:11,951
Said it wouldn't be
a problem if I took

588
00:22:11,953 --> 00:22:13,387
his father's place
tonight because...

589
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:15,505
...Dad never shows.
Dad never shows.

590
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,125
I was discussing
an artificial sweetener

591
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,061
with a suspect earlier on.

592
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:23,963
Yeah, looks and feels
like regular sugar,

593
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:25,098
but it's not.

594
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,317
There are minute differences,

595
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,802
carcinogenic ones in that case,

596
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:31,071
but it got me thinking
about some unusual sand

597
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,607
I noticed at the crash site.

598
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:36,142
It was new, hadn't been
weathered by the elements yet.

599
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,528
First I thought, "Well, the city
must have trucked it in

600
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,030
to offset erosion on the beach,"

601
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,648
but according
to the Parks Department,

602
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,033
they haven't done that
at Far Rockaway

603
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:44,984
in over a year,
so how did the sand

604
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,253
make it there?

605
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:47,954
In the fuel tank.

606
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:51,007
Sand dumped into the fuel tank

607
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:53,159
would initially settle
on the bottom.

608
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:56,296
Plane would take off,
no difficulty.

609
00:22:56,298 --> 00:23:00,333
But... during the course
of the flight,

610
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:03,169
more and more granules
will get sucked into the filter,

611
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:05,272
clogging it
and starving the engine

612
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:07,340
of fuel mid-flight,
regardless of the extra weight

613
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:08,558
of Hank Gerrard's body.

614
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,844
You think the flight
was bound to crash.

615
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,729
Actually, Ms. Molinari,

616
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:16,366
as of this moment,
I know it was bound to crash.

617
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:22,689
Same unfrosted grains

618
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:25,242
I saw at the crash site,
looks and feels

619
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:26,743
like beach sand, but it's not.

620
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:28,912
These grains are comprised
mostly of silica,

621
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:30,464
commercial sand.

622
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:32,065
Somebody sabotaged the flight.

623
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:34,367
Probably the same person
who killed Hank Gerrard.

624
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:36,336
What if Hank walked in
on the saboteur?

625
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:37,871
Easier to bash his skull in

626
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:39,673
then explain why
you're funneling sand

627
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:41,224
into a fuel tank, no?

628
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:42,375
Then it's just a case

629
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:43,477
of concealing the body.

630
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,978
The cargo hold makes sense

631
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,314
in that the flight was doomed
to crash anyway.

632
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:49,065
As long as it crashed
over water.

633
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,217
Which it would do
on its way to Martha's Vineyard.

634
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,386
Traces of sand would
be washed away.

635
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:56,890
Instead, it crashed prematurely
due to the weight imbalance.

636
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:59,109
So, we know why
Hank Gerrard's body

637
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:00,494
was stuffed into the cargo hold.

638
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:02,362
The questions are:
who put it there,

639
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:05,699
and why did they want
to bring down that plane?

640
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,731
You're home early.

641
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:25,357
Did you enjoy your time
with dear old Dad?

642
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:27,961
Oh, come on, Watson,

643
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:30,113
show a little appreciation
for a prank well played.

644
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:31,815
To pull that off,
I had to be

645
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:34,151
absolutely certain
my father wouldn't show.

646
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:36,153
I did mention that
he wouldn't show, didn't I?

647
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:38,605
Just out of curiosity,

648
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,657
why did the old tosspot
drop out this time?

649
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:44,178
Surely he's e-mailed you
some sort of apology by now.

650
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,546
He was called away

651
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:46,964
On important business, yeah.

652
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:50,000
An old one, but a good one.

653
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,303
Anyway, It's good
that you're back.

654
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,956
I realized earlier this evening
that the flight that crashed

655
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,925
was sabotaged.

656
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,843
The good news is I've been going
over Key Star Charter's

657
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,595
flight logs,
and I believe I've found

658
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:04,064
a mathematical quirk that has
pointed me in the direction

659
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:05,315
of a suspect.

660
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:06,650
I would like to go
and confront him.

661
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:08,769
So...

662
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:11,522
I waited for you.

663
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,390
Hm? You should be grateful.

664
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:15,642
If you want to go pound
on some criminal's door,

665
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:16,994
I suggest you call the police.

666
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:18,311
I'm going to bed.

667
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:21,582
You should've trusted me

668
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:23,200
when I told you
he wouldn't show.

669
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,285
Trusted you?

670
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,487
I've been glued to your
side for weeks now,

671
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:29,122
and you have refused to share

672
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:31,157
even the tiniest bit
of your personal history.

673
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,844
You know what, Sherlock,
I don't trust you.

674
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:35,312
Because thanks to you,

675
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:37,598
we're still basically
just strangers.

676
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:45,105
Ah, Mr. Holmes, right?

677
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,773
Mr. Barts, good
to see you again.

678
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:48,642
You didn't mention
when we met

679
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:50,176
that you're one of
Key Star's pilots.

680
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,396
Well, yeah, I am.

681
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:53,847
Is that a problem?

682
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,348
Well, not for me, no.

683
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,850
But for your recently
deceased colleague,

684
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:58,785
Joe Newell, maybe.

685
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,854
I don't understand.

686
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:02,990
Joe Newell's widow told me

687
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:04,691
that you and he
had a rather...

688
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:07,244
ugly disagreement
on the telephone

689
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:08,629
last week.

690
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:10,213
He wouldn't tell her
what it was about.

691
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,215
He just said that the problem
was being taken care of.

692
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,417
That was nothing.

693
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,885
Yeah, I poached
one of his regulars.

694
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,170
This rich guy
who flies to D.C. every week.

695
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:18,505
Good tipper.

696
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:21,076
Joe was angry,
but we worked it out.

697
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,828
We were thinking the argument
may have been

698
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,646
over something else.

699
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:25,914
You see,

700
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,115
when I realized that Joe's plane

701
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:28,550
had been sabotaged,

702
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:30,919
it occurred to me
that the saboteur

703
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:32,504
may have been
satisfying a grudge,

704
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:34,306
not against one of the
flight's passengers,

705
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:36,391
but against the airline itself.

706
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:39,511
Now I dug into some of the
logs that the NTSB gathered

707
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:41,463
from Key Star, and I noticed

708
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:42,898
something strange.

709
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,133
Every time you, Owen Barts,

710
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,436
piloted a plane
back from Miami,

711
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,472
you recorded an onboard
weight of exactly 66 pounds

712
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:54,159
over the weight of the
passengers and their baggage.

713
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:57,246
It's just a mistake
with my math.

714
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,981
The same mathematical mistake,
made again and again,

715
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:02,501
only when you return
from Miami, Florida.

716
00:27:02,503 --> 00:27:03,785
No.

717
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:05,420
You were accounting
for extra cargo.

718
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:08,957
You had to, because
accurate weight calculations

719
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,510
are critical when determining
the amount of fuel

720
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:13,495
required for a flight.

721
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:15,681
But why 66 pounds exactly?

722
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,266
A strange number.

723
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,685
Until you factor in
metric conversion.

724
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:24,072
66 pounds is the equivalent
of exactly 30 kilos.

725
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,608
Nice even number

726
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,176
for cocaine smuggling, no?

727
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:29,811
What happened?

728
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,563
Did Joe find out
and want a cut?

729
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:33,649
That's not likely,

730
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,350
given his reputation,
his military background.

731
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:37,018
It's more likely
that he threatened to go

732
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,520
to the authorities
if you didn't stop.

733
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:40,239
Either way,

734
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,041
you engineered a plane crash
to eliminate the threat.

735
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:47,246
Problem was, Hank Gerrard
caught you in the act.

736
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,331
You improvised.

737
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,366
You killed him.

738
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:53,585
Concealed his body
in the cargo hold of a plane

739
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:55,621
that you knew was gonna crash.

740
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:59,141
It's quite a... quite a story.

741
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,393
There's just one problem.

742
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:03,912
I was nowhere near the hangar
this morning.

743
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:05,914
I was with my boss, Charles.

744
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:07,482
His car stalled,

745
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:10,485
so I had to stop by his place
to give him a jump.

746
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,387
Don't believe me, go ask him.

747
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:13,822
He'll tell you.

748
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:15,107
I couldn't have killed
Mr. Gerrard

749
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,943
or sabotaged that plane.

750
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:25,951
Holy...

751
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,085
You were right.

752
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:29,404
Yesterday, when
you suggested

753
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:31,607
I had a certain preoccupation
with plane crashes.

754
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:35,360
It is why I was drawn
to this case.

755
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,431
I'm not phobic, mind you.

756
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:40,766
Nothing so illogical.

757
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:43,018
I just...
the amount I see

758
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,470
when I board an aircraft...

759
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:47,922
The pilot looks confident,

760
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:50,258
but I detect a slight tremor
in his hands.

761
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,610
He's nervous.
Is he hiding something?

762
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:53,061
If yes, what?

763
00:28:53,063 --> 00:28:55,147
Has he had a few drinks
to settle his nerves?

764
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:56,865
What about the mechanic
performing a last-second check?

765
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:59,117
Why does he look so unhappy?
Does he hate his job?

766
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,486
If he hates his job,
how much care is he taking?

767
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,171
I get it.

768
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:06,625
You're still cross with me?

769
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:11,146
I was attempting to demonstrate
my trust in you.

770
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:12,948
How?

771
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,467
By telling me something
I already figured out?

772
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:17,502
You want more?

773
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,924
Detective Bell?

774
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:25,911
I just heard back
from Charles Cooper.

775
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,295
He's on his way to the station.

776
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,980
Thought you might want
to join us.

777
00:29:28,982 --> 00:29:31,400
Owen called me last night,

778
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,984
uh, in a panic.

779
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:34,686
He said he needed my help.

780
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,238
It's glue again.

781
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,522
It's worse this time.

782
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:39,241
It's like he bathed
in the stuff.

783
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:40,826
He told me he'd made
a big mistake.

784
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:44,029
That he'd used
the Key Star planes

785
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:46,198
to smuggle drugs.

786
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,332
Mr. Cooper, are you okay?

787
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:49,051
You look a little pale.

788
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,336
No, I guess I'm just I shock.

789
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:53,154
I mean...

790
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:55,207
O-Owen had worked for me
for years.

791
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:57,008
He was a friend,

792
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,527
just like Joe was.

793
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,062
But he said that, uh,

794
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,464
Joe had figured it out

795
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,332
and threatened to call
the police

796
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,218
if he didn't stop.

797
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,054
But Owen didn't want to stop,
and so...

798
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,889
he, uh...

799
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:12,357
Mr. Cooper, did Owen tell you

800
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,777
he had something to do
with the plane crash?

801
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,530
He wanted me to tell you guys
that he was with me

802
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:20,649
at the time
of Mr. Gerrard's murder.

803
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,402
But he wasn't.

804
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,404
Could you excuse
us for a second?

805
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:34,746
Get a team over to Owen Barts'
residence right now.

806
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:36,248
I'm gonna call for a warrant.

807
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,583
Ink will be dry before your foot
goes through his door.

808
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:39,801
Yes, sir.

809
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,520
No Barts?

810
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:43,054
Lot of drawers tossed inside.

811
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:45,039
Looks like he packed
a bag in a hurry.

812
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,058
Now, his car is gone
too-- blue Toyota Camry.

813
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,677
We got a BOLO out.

814
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,645
What's weird
is what is here.

815
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:51,930
Going by the dimensions,
I'd say it's

816
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,266
a safe bet this is the
weapon used to kill him.

817
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:56,818
So let me get this straight:
Owen Barts kills

818
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,104
Hank Gerrard with this wrench,
but he doesn't dispose of it

819
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:01,490
in some place
we aren't gonna find it.

820
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,224
He doesn't even clean it.

821
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:05,393
He just leaves it
in his garage?

822
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,496
Like I said, weird.

823
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,564
Not just weird.

824
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:11,817
Utterly ridiculous.

825
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:13,452
What's that?

826
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,705
Spartina patens.

827
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:17,923
It's a type of cord grass

828
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,258
which grows only
in brackish water.

829
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,510
Brackish?

830
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,345
It's a combination of fresh
and salt water.

831
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:24,713
Hmm.

832
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,298
It's still a bit moist,

833
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,683
which means the wrench was
in the water...

834
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:31,970
recently.

835
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:40,428
I think someone
did dispose of it

836
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,148
and retrieved it...

837
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:47,953
...and planted it here.

838
00:31:47,955 --> 00:31:51,156
Probably right
after they killed Owen Barts.

839
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:52,624
I get why

840
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,125
you think the wrench
was planted,

841
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:56,845
but what makes you think
Barts is dead?

842
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:58,380
His car.

843
00:31:58,382 --> 00:31:59,831
You said it as a Camry?

844
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,383
Solid, practical choice.

845
00:32:01,385 --> 00:32:02,968
But look at this--

846
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,503
full-synthetic motor oil.

847
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,137
It's high-end.

848
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:10,559
Used to maintain peak lubricity
in high-performance engines.

849
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,010
Not the four-cylinder
engine of a Camry.

850
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,646
Hmm.

851
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:20,485
Imagine you're Owen Barts.

852
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,504
You've just been
told by your boss,

853
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,940
Charles Cooper, that
he won't alibi you

854
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:27,325
for the murder
of Hank Gerrard.

855
00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:30,111
You decide to go on the lam.

856
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:32,497
You rush home...

857
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,649
you pack up your things,

858
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,918
and then you decide to
leave what seems to be

859
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,955
between 50 and 100,000

860
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,173
of your hard-earned
smuggling dollars

861
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:44,342
in your garage.

862
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:46,494
Not a chance.

863
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:48,296
So who else
may have been profiting

864
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,665
from the smuggling operation
at Key Star Charters, hmm?

865
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,851
Who else who would've seen
Joe Newell as a threat

866
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:55,887
and had the technical know-how
to sabotage his plane?

867
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:57,105
The same guy who told us

868
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,558
Owen Barts confessed
to everything.

869
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,193
Charles Cooper.

870
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,731
I don't know how many
times I can tell you.

871
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:12,693
Owen called me last night.

872
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:14,009
He told me that he sabotaged

873
00:33:14,011 --> 00:33:15,344
Joe's plane.

874
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:16,795
I'm sorry if you can't find him.

875
00:33:16,797 --> 00:33:19,264
Have you ever seen
a poorer excuse for a liar?

876
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:21,717
Are you sure he did
everything you said he did?

877
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,268
Note the pallor,
the perspiration,

878
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,938
the inability to
hold eye contact.

879
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,255
All telltale
signs of deceit.

880
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,725
And some serious
medical conditions.

881
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:33,495
I'm just saying,
the guy looks like he's dying.

882
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:36,331
He's our murderer
and our saboteur.

883
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,250
Now it's just a matter
of getting him

884
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:40,719
to admit it.

885
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,692
Something wrong?

886
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,712
No, I just never noticed
that scar before, that's all.

887
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:51,997
How'd you get it?

888
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,866
Boyhood misadventure.

889
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,202
Fell off a fence.

890
00:33:57,204 --> 00:34:00,422
A compound fracture,
hence the scar.

891
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:07,396
I just remembered
an errand I forgot to run.

892
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:11,316
You gonna be okay
on your own for a while?

893
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:13,435
Somehow I'll soldier on.

894
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,114
Problem?

895
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:27,666
He won't cop to it.

896
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:29,368
But he's on the precipice,
you can tell.

897
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,619
He's sweating,
his hands are trembling.

898
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:31,903
We've come at him

899
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,588
with everything we got;
he won't budge.

900
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,090
Because he knows
we got no proof.

901
00:34:35,092 --> 00:34:37,242
His frame-up of Owen Barts
may not have been perfect,

902
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,845
but he knows we can't show
he had anything to do with it.

903
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:41,579
What?

904
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:43,598
It's got, it's got into you now.
Model glue.

905
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:47,019
That's probably why
he looks so ill.

906
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:50,055
Fumes are finally
getting to him.

907
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:01,233
That's Cooper's glass,
correct?

908
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:03,251
His third one,
if you can believe it.

909
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:04,619
Cut him off.

910
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:06,038
No, no, no.

911
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,606
I think you should
bring him a pitcher.

912
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:13,378
I was wondering
if you could help me...

913
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,629
Alistair.

914
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,665
Miss Watson.

915
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,300
What a surprise.

916
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:20,919
But if you're here for
an encore performance...

917
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:23,121
I know you're not just
some actor Sherlock hired.

918
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,473
You know him.

919
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:27,476
He engaged me through
my representation.

920
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:28,760
I've never even seen
the man...

921
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,128
That story you told me,

922
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,630
the one about his broken wrist;
it was true.

923
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,483
He would've never
shared that with you

924
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:36,234
if you were just some actor.

925
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,903
Especially not to play
some stupid prank.

926
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:40,272
How did you find me, if
you don't mind me asking?

927
00:35:40,274 --> 00:35:41,723
The receipt you dropped.

928
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,475
It had the name
of this bookstore on it.

929
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,827
You got a 20% discount;
members get ten.

930
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:47,612
I realized
you must work here.

931
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:49,781
You've been spending
quite a bit of time

932
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:50,999
with him, haven't you?

933
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,952
I really am an actor,
you know.

934
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:56,621
In London, I had a small
part in a radio drama.

935
00:35:58,008 --> 00:36:00,425
Yeah, we still have
those across the pond.

936
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:03,545
Sherlock wrote me a letter when
he was ten, saying that I alone

937
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:06,431
of all the cast truly captured
the Yorkshire accent.

938
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:10,135
Yeah, I thought
it was odd.

939
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:11,970
But I was also
very flattered.

940
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:13,939
So eventually, we met,

941
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,607
so I could coach
him on its nuances.

942
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:16,775
We became friends.

943
00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:19,311
Sherlock doesn't have friends.

944
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:20,946
Not in the traditional sense.

945
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:23,231
He drops in and out,
appears at odd moments

946
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:26,284
to make outrageous and
highly specific requests.

947
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:30,021
Respectfully, that doesn't sound
much like a friendship to me.

948
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,741
Then perhaps you better
revise your definition.

949
00:36:32,743 --> 00:36:34,242
You can't expect Sherlock Holmes

950
00:36:34,244 --> 00:36:36,428
to relate to you
the way others might.

951
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,630
The moment you do,
he'll migrate

952
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:41,266
out of your life,
and you'll be the poorer for it.

953
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,754
You do realize that, don't you?

954
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,057
He told you about me, right?

955
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:50,091
Yeah.

956
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:51,309
You know what my job is?

957
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:52,511
I do.

958
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:55,514
And for what
it's worth, um...

959
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:58,767
I'm very glad
he has you.

960
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,087
You knew him when he was using?

961
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:08,726
Well, after I first
came here in '06,

962
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:12,164
we mostly kept in touch
by e-mail.

963
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,583
I knew he was dabbling
on and off,

964
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:17,836
but I was confident
that he would grow out of it.

965
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,423
Nine months ago, he shows up
at my flat at night,

966
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:23,708
so high he could barely speak.

967
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,043
Well, I flushed
his drugs

968
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:27,045
and I looked after
him for a day or so.

969
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:30,348
It was very...

970
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,095
difficult for me
to see his mind so addled.

971
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:37,573
He could barely
stay conscious.

972
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:40,609
And when he kept muttering the
same name again and again...

973
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:41,759
What name?

974
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:42,978
It doesn't matter.

975
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,930
I asked him about it
the next morning.

976
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:48,033
He assured me it meant nothing.

977
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,435
Did you believe him?

978
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,976
Look... I want to help him,

979
00:37:57,978 --> 00:38:00,879
but I think you know
how difficult that can be.

980
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,780
I thought,
if I could talk to you,

981
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:06,968
that maybe you could help me
get a better sense of...

982
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,087
of what to do.

983
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:13,458
Anyway...

984
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,128
thank you...

985
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,764
for your time.

986
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:22,133
I'm sorry if I bothered you.

987
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,302
Miss Watson?

988
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,523
I have a strong
suspicion that that name

989
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:30,975
meant more to him
than he claimed.

990
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:37,332
I think perhaps
you should have it.

991
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,257
Mr. Cooper.

992
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,008
Nice to see you again.

993
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,543
Do you need to urinate?

994
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:50,128
What?

995
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,197
Do you need to urinate?

996
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,666
No, I'm good, thanks.

997
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:58,270
Last night, when you struggled
with your co-conspirator, Owen,

998
00:38:58,272 --> 00:39:00,105
he nicked you with something.

999
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:01,222
A kitchen knife, perhaps?

1000
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:02,891
Excuse me?
Obviously, you...

1001
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:05,694
you got the better of him,
but given your pallor,

1002
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:08,730
I'd say that the wound
was significant.

1003
00:39:08,732 --> 00:39:11,299
I believed you earlier on when
you said that you were in shock.

1004
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:12,951
But now I think
it's something else:

1005
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:14,235
blood loss.

1006
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:16,121
Pint or two, if I had to guess.

1007
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:17,855
That's why you're so thirsty.

1008
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,024
Your body needs to replace
the fluids that it's lost.

1009
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,526
If it didn't,
then you'd have asked

1010
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,461
to visit the loo
quite some time ago.

1011
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:25,914
I'm sorry,
but you think I'm a killer

1012
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,666
because I didn't
go to the bathroom, hm?

1013
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:29,534
That and the model glue.

1014
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,969
You stink of it.

1015
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:32,220
Initially, I'd assumed
that you just

1016
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:33,555
spilled some on your clothing,

1017
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:35,557
but now that I know
about the wound...

1018
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,675
What wound?

1019
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:38,176
The one beneath
your clothing.

1020
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:39,877
The one that you sealed
with the adhesive

1021
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,379
you use to build
your model planes.

1022
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,731
It's an old
military trick.

1023
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:45,517
Field medics use it
to seal up a wound

1024
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,851
when there isn't
time for stitches.

1025
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:48,937
You used it to avoid
a trip to the hospital

1026
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:50,605
'cause you didn't want
the injury on record.

1027
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:53,274
You know, I think
I've given you guys

1028
00:39:53,276 --> 00:39:54,826
enough of my time today.

1029
00:39:54,828 --> 00:39:56,745
Okay, you want to leave?
That's not a problem.

1030
00:39:56,747 --> 00:40:00,615
Just take off your shirt and
your pants, show us I'm wrong.

1031
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,369
I cut my side open

1032
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:07,172
on a sharp piece of metal
in my hangar last night.

1033
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,240
I was going to get stitches,
Owen called.

1034
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,709
I was upset.

1035
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,928
And I'd used glue
on a cut before, so...

1036
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,865
Let's say he's right,
Mr. Cooper.

1037
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:22,554
How much blood do you think
ended up on Owen's body?

1038
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,639
Do you know how easy
it's gonna be for us

1039
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:27,425
to tie you to his murder,
once we find it?

1040
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,927
I didn't murder anyone.

1041
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,896
And there is no body.
Course there is.

1042
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:34,399
I even think
I know where to find it.

1043
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,067
Jamaica Bay or Alley Pond Park.

1044
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:38,737
It was the wrench.

1045
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,938
You threw it in a body
of brackish water

1046
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,640
after you murdered Hank Gerrard.

1047
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:45,109
The only ones in New York are
the ones I just mentioned.

1048
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,779
Last night, when Owen called you
and told you we were onto

1049
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:49,247
the smuggling
and the sabotage,

1050
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:50,749
you went and retrieved it.

1051
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:52,050
You killed him,

1052
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:54,169
and then you planted it
in his garage

1053
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:57,555
so we'd pin everything on him
and him alone.

1054
00:40:57,557 --> 00:40:59,591
Was a lazy bit of framing,
if you ask me,

1055
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:01,142
but you are wounded.

1056
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:02,394
So...

1057
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,796
here's the thing, Mr. Cooper.

1058
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,465
I know that you killed
Owen Barts,

1059
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,051
just like I know that you killed
your "friend" Joe Newell

1060
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,637
and his passengers.

1061
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,740
I also know that you like to
hide things in brackish water.

1062
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:18,643
Now, a dead body is considerably
larger than a wrench,

1063
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:21,446
but you were in no condition
to dig a grave last night.

1064
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:23,598
Jamaica Bay and
Alley Pond Park

1065
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,750
are very large areas,
but the NYPD

1066
00:41:25,752 --> 00:41:28,486
is planning on
searching them both.

1067
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:29,704
You could save them

1068
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:31,790
a great deal of
time and trouble,

1069
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:35,093
and tell them where Owen is,
or you could continue to lie.

1070
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:37,796
Thing is, if you lie,
you'll just give the D.A.

1071
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:40,682
more time to consider
making this a federal case.

1072
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:42,517
Uncle Sam doesn't
take too kindly

1073
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,136
to people who bring down planes.

1074
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:47,972
The death penalty
is a real possibility.

1075
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:52,143
My advice?

1076
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:55,113
Tell us everything
you know.

1077
00:41:55,115 --> 00:42:00,068
The great State of New York will
only give you life in prison.

1078
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,546
I take it you made your case
against Charles Cooper?

1079
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:13,665
Ah, the police made the case.

1080
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,450
I just lent a helping hand.

1081
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:20,338
An enormous helping hand,
but still.

1082
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,723
What is it?

1083
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,159
You look peculiar.

1084
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:27,695
I guess there's a question
I want to ask you.

1085
00:42:27,697 --> 00:42:28,980
About your past.

1086
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:31,149
Excellent.

1087
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,935
You wait here, I'll go
to my room, shut the door.

1088
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:36,237
As soon as you're absolutely
certain I can't hear you,

1089
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,689
ask away.

1090
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:39,891
I know about Irene.

1091
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:43,795
I want you to tell me about her.

1092
