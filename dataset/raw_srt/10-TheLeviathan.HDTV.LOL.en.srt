00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:05,970
(keypad beeping)

2
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:10,408
â™ª

3
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,387
(doorbell rings)

4
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,672
Hey, are you gonna
get that or...

5
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,508
(TV playing quietly)

6
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,694
Hey, Sherlock's asleep.

7
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:49,030
I wasn't sure
if I should get the door.

8
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,851
I'm Gwen-- you're
the companion, right?

9
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,703
Yes.
(doorbell rings)

10
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:58,789
Guess I should
go get dressed.

11
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,291
(laughs)

12
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,877
(doorbell rings)

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,052
(doorbell rings)

14
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:12,870
WOMAN: Sorry, I wasn't
sure if you wanted me

15
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,005
to get...

16
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,724
Oh, you're
not Sherlock.

17
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:18,142
You're the companion, right?

18
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,844
Yes.

19
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,378
I'm Olivia.
It's nice to meet you.

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,014
I think I just met your sister.

21
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,016
Did she mention what time our
car service is getting here?

22
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,434
(doorbell rings)
No.

23
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:27,852
You should get the door.

24
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,937
There's crepes
downstairs if you want.

25
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,190
Good morning.

26
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:37,028
Well, if you must know, Watson,
the Lynch sisters and I enjoy

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,579
a mutually beneficial
relationship.

28
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,331
"If I must know?"
I didn't ask.

29
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,116
I need to study the difference
between two specimens born

30
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:43,918
into the world with exactly
the same genetic material.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,121
In the Lynches case,
there are seven major ones.

32
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,539
And they get...

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,908
I... didn't... ask.

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,260
(doorbell rings)

35
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:53,761
If that's for me,
I'm not here.

36
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:54,929
I'm going back to bed,

37
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,764
after I see the Lynches off.

38
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,883
Good morning.

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,018
Does, um,
Sherlock Holmes live here?

40
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,303
I was referred here

41
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:04,105
by an old colleague
of his in London.

42
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:05,923
He said I might have
to try more than once.

43
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,808
Good advice.
Would you please tell him

44
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,760
that I need
to speak with him?

45
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,612
Why don't you
tell him yourself.

46
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:19,570
Casterly Rock Security.

47
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,106
The world's foremost maker
of bank vaults.

48
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,242
And you, Mr. Erlich, are the
president and head engineer.

49
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,545
I am familiar with
your work. Crepe?

50
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:33,117
Bye, Sherlock.

51
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:39,140
If you know our work,
you know that

52
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,759
we introduced a new flagship
product in 2009.

53
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,095
The Leviathan.
Yes.

54
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,848
The safe that you marketed
as impregnable.

55
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,185
Did you people learn nothing
from the <i>Titanic?</i>

56
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,187
Bye, Sherlock.

57
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:02,413
Your company introduced a
supposedly unbreakable safe

58
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,249
in 2009, and then paid
the price for your hubris

59
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,537
when The Leviathan was plundered
within the calendar year.

60
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,989
Thank you.

61
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,959
The four men who robbed
that bank, they were brilliant.

62
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,995
A once-in-a-lifetime assembly
of criminal talent.

63
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,515
Now, eventually all four
were caught and convicted,

64
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,167
but none of them talked.

65
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,970
We did what we could to improve
the product, but the chance

66
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,724
of another four criminals
that bright collaborating again?

67
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:32,143
And yet, here you sit.

68
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:37,281
The Svalbard Diamond Exchange
was robbed last night.

69
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,201
They're missing
$40 million in stones.

70
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:42,153
Stones protected
by your vault.

71
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,873
The Leviathan has
a seven-figure price tag.

72
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,626
If somebody finds out that
another one's been compromised

73
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,462
and we don't know how,
we're done.

74
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:55,699
Well, the police must be looking
into who robbed your vault.

75
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,368
I take it the "how"
is where I come in?

76
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,806
I think that there must have
been a fifth conspirator.

77
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,091
Someone the other thieves
never told us about.

78
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,143
Poppycock.

79
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,645
The height of
intellectual vanity.

80
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,346
If one group of people
can figure out

81
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:10,848
to get past your vault,

82
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,433
so can a second...
No, you don't understand.

83
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:15,069
We have six layers
of bleeding-edge security,

84
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,720
redundancy at every step.

85
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,222
And if a second group can,
so can a third.

86
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,389
If you want to know the answer,

87
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,741
just take me
to the diamond exchange.

88
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:21,942
We'll talk fee
on the way,

89
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,611
although I'm not sure I have

90
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,497
a rate for a job that's only
gonna take an hour or two.

91
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,732
HOLMES:
<i>The security upstairs is</i>

92
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,400
rather rudimentary.

93
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,569
I take it anything of value
is stowed in the vault,

94
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,570
after hours.

95
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,239
Mr. Erlich.

96
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,757
The police said
that your consultant

97
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,575
can't see the vault
till they're done.

98
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:41,011
I'm also a consultant
with the NYPD, Mister...?

99
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,347
Batonvert, David Batonvert.
I'm the floor manager here.

100
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,965
I can assure you I know
how to conduct myself

101
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,416
at a crime scene, Mr. Batonvert.

102
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,752
Your name means
"green stick" in French.

103
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,221
Uh, yeah?

104
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,524
So, you have a motion sensor

105
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,060
embedded in the ceiling,
a light sensor on the wall.

106
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,562
Cardboard box can take care
of the motion sensor.

107
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,316
The light detector they would
mask with simple black tape.

108
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,902
They made short work
of that lock.

109
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,538
Body heat sensor in the ceiling
could be coated with hair spray,

110
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,624
buy a little time,
which brings us to...

111
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,110
the door itself, yes.

112
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,463
She is beautiful, hmm.

113
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,048
This lock is not pickable.

114
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,783
That key is, what, a foot long?

115
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:22,002
The tumblers are weighted
so they cannot be manipulated

116
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:23,787
with a pick.

117
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,306
You could, of course,

118
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:28,309
put a tiny camera
on this fire extinguisher.

119
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:29,510
If you knew
an excellent locksmith,

120
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:31,178
you could provide
an image of the key,

121
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,346
have it duplicated.

122
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:35,232
Clever, but we
already knew that.

123
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,569
Ten-digit access code?

124
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,655
Yes, it's provided by
a random number generator

125
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:42,690
that's hardwired
into the system.

126
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:43,691
The code changes
every two minutes.

127
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,142
Who has the code?

128
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,311
It appears on a key fob
that the owner carries.

129
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,164
If you want to get in there,
he's got to read it to you.

130
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,999
He's in Gstaad right now.

131
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,667
He's had the fob on him
the whole time.

132
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,452
You could attack
the random number generator,

133
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,654
make it spit out a pattern,
so you could predict the code.

134
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,157
The number generator
is working perfectly.

135
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:07,264
I'm gonna need
a little time with this.

136
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,845
(keypad beeping)

137
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,535
What are you doing down here?

138
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,186
Stress testing the keypad.

139
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,789
You think there'd be some tell
in the keys themselves.

140
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,523
No, I mean, what are you
still doing down here?

141
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,359
You said you were gonna
be gone two hours.

142
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,994
It's been all day.
Has it?

143
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,829
How stubborn are you
gonna be about this?

144
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,998
Uh, excuse me?
We're closing now.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,400
Green Stick, do you want
your diamonds back or not?

146
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:59,600
(gasps)

147
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:00,840
Oh, she thinks she's
a clever one, doesn't she?

148
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:01,719
Who's she?

149
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,404
Her.
What time is it?

150
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,939
She generates an ocean
of pure randomness,

151
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,890
and she wants you
to just lose hope and drown

152
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,910
in all those numbers,
but I can see the horizon line.

153
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:10,945
I can tread water.

154
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,696
Stop.

155
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,698
It is 2:00 in the morning.

156
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,400
You've been down here for
almost, what, 17 hours?

157
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,252
So?
So.

158
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,537
I'm supposed to meet my mother
for brunch in the morning.

159
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,073
Not spending the night in a bank vault.
So, go then.

160
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,875
I'm not gonna leave you
down here like this either.

161
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,044
In A.A., they'd say
you're on a dry drunk.

162
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,246
You're indulging in all
the obsessions of addiction

163
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,415
without actually using drugs,
so are you gonna admit

164
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,550
that you can't think your
way past that vault door

165
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,686
or am I gonna have to
smash the fire alarm

166
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,254
and get us both
dragged out of here?

167
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,256
You're absolutely
right, Watson.

168
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,308
I can sometimes disappear into
the rabbit hole of my psyche.

169
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,610
Okay, good, then
you're ready to go.

170
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,061
Would you mind terribly
if I just tried

171
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,613
one more idea before we leave?
(groans)

172
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,481
It'll only take a minute.
Fine.

173
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:49,984
(glass shatters)

174
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,285
What are you doing?!

175
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:53,454
Oh, my God, put that down!

176
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,489
Put that down!

177
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,828
Before you say anything,

178
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,796
I would like to remind you
that I'm holding an ax.

179
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:07,241

â™ª

182
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,034
Did you give the people
at Casterly Rock

183
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:34,069
my cell phone number
as your contact info?

184
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:36,238
Well, I didn't want
them to call me.

185
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,741
Yeah, well, they're wondering
who took an ax to their vault.

186
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,576
Apparently the repair bill's
gonna be huge.

187
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:42,044
Cost of doing business.

188
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,912
They'll get over it
when I figure this out.

189
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,798
We need to figure out

190
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,384
who broke into the safe;
that's the way that we'll learn

191
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,135
how it happened.

192
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,720
It wasn't an inside job.

193
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,422
Everyone at Casterly
Rock who knew

194
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,758
how to get into that
thing has given an alibi.

195
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,726
And I can't see how
the original thieves

196
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:59,178
would've needed
a fifth conspirator.

197
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,713
The four of them had
all the tools they needed

198
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:02,981
between them.

199
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,651
No, obvious what happened.

200
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:08,153
One of the original team
sold the recipe

201
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:11,573
for breaching The Leviathan
to an outside party.

202
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:13,692
That's obvious?

203
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:16,061
When you've eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains,

204
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,730
however improbable,
is the truth.

205
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,866
And what's impossible here
is that you couldn't break

206
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:23,085
into the safe, but
someone else could.

207
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:26,955
In other worlds, you are the
smartest man in the world.

208
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:31,210
Waiting for you to chime in
and say that's ridiculous.

209
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,962
You'd think it would be
easy to get one of the four

210
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:36,799
original team to admit that
they sold the secret on.

211
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,467
But Carter Averill,

212
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,586
the man who organized the heist
died in prison last year,

213
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:43,856
and the other three have yet
to respond to my request

214
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:45,457
for a visit.

215
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,976
(phone ringing)

216
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:50,279
You should answer that.

217
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,097
Tell them it was
a necessary part of my process.

218
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,982
What are my keys doing here?

219
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,267
They weigh
the right amount.

220
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,985
And enjoy brunch
with your mother.

221
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,987
I hadn't realized
you were still so eager

222
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,739
to impress her.

223
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:02,491
You're dressed like
you're going to a job interview,

224
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,743
not brunch with
a loved one.

225
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:13,635
(speaking Mandarin)

226
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:16,621
Okay, I was still
reading that.

227
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:18,390
I told them to bring us
whatever's freshest.

228
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,126
So, I'm in the cab

229
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:23,428
on the way over,
and guess who I hear from.

230
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,230
(phone ringing)

231
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,851
Do you have to take that?

232
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,519
No. Go on.

233
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,138
Your brother called.

234
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,307
He called me; do you know
how rare that is?

235
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:38,694
I haven't spoken to Oren
in, what, two months?

236
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,279
He's coming to the city.

237
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,114
And he's
bringing Gabrielle.

238
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,615
Wow.

239
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:46,168
He tried to cut his trip short
in order to come back

240
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,337
for dinner with us tomorrow
night, but it didn't work out.

241
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:49,505
Wait, tomorrow night?

242
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,822
Mm-hmm.

243
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,341
Mom, you know about
my job, right?

244
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,009
I mean, I can't just
leave my client alone.

245
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,211
This is your brother, Joan.

246
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:57,462
Can't your client just get

247
00:10:57,464 --> 00:10:58,764
a different babysitter
for tomorrow night?

248
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:01,499
"Babysitter."
Okay, here we go.

249
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,551
(phone ringing)

250
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,852
I didn't mean it that way.

251
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,305
You know, I'm just
gonna get that,

252
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:08,473
because it's just gonna...
Mm.

253
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:09,808
Hey, everything okay?

254
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,143
HOLMES:
Excellent, actually.

255
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:12,861
Don't come back
to the brownstone.

256
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:14,813
Meet me at Sing Sing Prison
at 2:30.

257
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,182
Why do you want me to meet you
at Sing Sing?

258
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:18,617
Charles Briggs, the lock-pick

259
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:20,152
from the original team
of thieves--

260
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:21,870
he's agreed to sit down with us.

261
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,355
Okay.

262
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:25,190
Okay, I'll see you there.

263
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,543
Sing Sing, the prison?

264
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:30,012
(door buzzes)
BRIGGS: <i>You said you want to know</i>

265
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,914
how we got
into Leviathan.

266
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,416
And you think
for some reason,

267
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:37,803
even though I kept my mouth shut
during the trial,

268
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,138
I'm going to tell you.

269
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,007
You did agree to see me,

270
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,976
which implies
you have a price.

271
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:46,378
You're one of the
best lock-pickers

272
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,213
in the world,

273
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:51,383
and I collect
expertise, Mr. Briggs,

274
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:53,735
people to help me with
my consultancy work

275
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:55,487
on an as-needed basis.

276
00:11:55,489 --> 00:12:00,225
I think I could find a use
for a mind as lively as yours.

277
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,827
You want me to work
for the cops?

278
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:04,279
I want to offer you a
chance to use your brain.

279
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:05,914
I suspect

280
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,699
it'll be the only
such offer you get

281
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,567
for the rest of
your natural life.

282
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,540
How did you get past
The Leviathan door,

283
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,843
and who did you
sell your secret to?

284
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:23,415
I don't know exactly
how we got in.

285
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,417
We were specialized.

286
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:28,103
I was responsible for getting
past the outer door.

287
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:29,972
Averill figured out the code,

288
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:32,357
but never told the rest of us
how he did it.

289
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:35,227
After he got sick, he told me
someone got in touch with him.

290
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:37,729
Averill said this guy wanted
to know how he did it,

291
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:39,147
and he was willing to pay.

292
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,817
If you're saying
that somebody else

293
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,485
broke into one
of those vaults,

294
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:45,603
my guess is Carter saw
an opportunity

295
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:48,206
to get a little money
for his family before he died,

296
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,908
told the guy his secret.

297
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,293
Who was it?

298
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:53,045
I only know an alias.

299
00:12:55,915 --> 00:13:00,502
Even if you never find this guy,
which you won't...

300
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,672
...is that enough
to land me this gig?

301
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:09,011
The guy who Averill said
got in touch with him,

302
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:12,014
everyone just calls him...

303
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:14,566
Le Chevalier.

304
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,468
WATSON:
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>

305
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,769
This Le Chevalier guy,
he's a thief

306
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:19,321
who's allegedly stolen

307
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:21,189
an original copy
of Shakespeare's first folio,

308
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,807
a collection
of ancient Greek coins...

309
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,760
And Van Gogh's <i>PietÃ ,</i>
among things.

310
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,279
And no one can give us
a description of him?

311
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:30,949
No one knows if he's European,
American, a leprechaun.

312
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,584
You're making a point
of some kind.

313
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,002
Sounds like a fairy tale.

314
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:35,704
Well, some
people think so.

315
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,539
But all five robberies
attributed to Le Chevalier

316
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,007
remain unsolved.

317
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,876
And you asked Charles Briggs
for the name of the man

318
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,794
who bought the secret,
and he gives you a legend,

319
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:44,329
a man who might not
even exist.

320
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:45,847
You know,
this is a snipe hunt.

321
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:47,332
Briggs said it himself.

322
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:49,267
No one's ever even come close
to finding him.

323
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,686
You're forgetting
one thing, Watson.

324
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,437
I've never gone
looking for him.

325
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,755
WATSON:
<i>This painting was stolen</i>

326
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:55,857
the same night
that the Aster Museum

327
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:57,342
finally unveiled
it to the public.

328
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:58,894
Now, most people think
it was Le Chevalier.

329
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:00,979
If he's real,
this guy's got style.

330
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:02,364
This man is real.

331
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,199
There is a singular sensibility
at work here.

332
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:05,484
You can't just...

333
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,069
sell these things
on the black market.

334
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:08,853
They're too unique for that.

335
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,461
Hmm.

336
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:17,496
Who's that?

337
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:19,848
HOLMES:
That is Peter Kent.

338
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,968
He is head
of the Kent Philanthropic Trust

339
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,586
and leader
of the fundraising drive

340
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:28,173
that led to the acquisition
of <i>The PietÃ .</i>

341
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,976
Look at his cufflinks.

342
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:36,481
They're fashioned from
silver tetradrachms.

343
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:37,899
They're Greek coins.

344
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:42,354
Now... look at the coins

345
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:45,607
Le Chevalier stole.

346
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:47,725
WATSON:
They're the same.

347
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:49,727
HOLMES:
That's Le Chevalier.

348
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:53,582
Le Chevalier may be
the stuff of legend,

349
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,567
but Peter Kent

350
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:59,004
is listed in the phone book.

351
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,342
WOMAN:
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

352
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:05,594
<i>I'm a little confused.</i>

353
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:07,429
You're here to speak
with Peter Kent?

354
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,914
Yeah, tell him it's
about Greek tetradrachms.

355
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,633
He'll know what I mean.

356
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,391
Is that a real Hopper?

357
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:21,777
Yeah, they're
all original.

358
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,429
You could buy an island
with the art on these walls.

359
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,698
Except that.

360
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,350
That's a lithograph,

361
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:31,269
worth maybe $40.

362
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:37,292
He wouldn't be so brazen.

363
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:51,890
What are you doing?!

364
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:16,531
I give you
Van Gogh's <i>PietÃ .</i>

365
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,167
We found Le Chevalier.

366
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:22,754
What in God's name
are you doing?

367
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:23,788
You're not Peter Kent.

368
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,657
No, he's my father.

369
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,843
He's also a thief,
as you can see.

370
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:30,879
He stole <i>The PietÃ ,</i>
and two nights ago,

371
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,098
he robbed the Svalbard
Diamond Exchange.

372
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,332
Two nights ago?

373
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:36,885
I know this may come
as a bit of a shock,

374
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,937
but I assure you,

375
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:40,472
that painting
is genuine.

376
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:42,607
I don't know anything
about that,

377
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:43,859
but I'm positive
my father didn't

378
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:45,610
steal anything two nights ago.

379
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:49,397
My father had a
stroke two years ago.

380
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,017
He hasn't spoken or stood

381
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,237
in more than 18 months.

382
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:59,074
You were right.

383
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:01,459
Charles Briggs sent
us on a snipe hunt.

384
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:11,067
I'll tell you what.
I won't be using Charles Briggs

385
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,919
as a consultant
anytime soon.

386
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,772
I can't believe I got on
the subway with a Chopard watch.

387
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:19,292
There are 200 carats
of diamonds on that thing.

388
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:21,561
I don't even want to know
how much it costs.

389
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:23,430
The watch is
$25 million.

390
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,515
The <i>PietÃ </i> almost
twice that,

391
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,750
if recent auctions
are anything to go by.

392
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:29,886
Got away with
it, didn't we?

393
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:33,356
Neither one of us wanted to
put a stroke victim in jail,

394
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:35,758
and Peter Kent's son doesn't
really want the world

395
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,777
to know what his
father did for a hobby.

396
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,779
Yeah, it's the best
solution for all parties.

397
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,698
I'd like to hear you
explain that in court.

398
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,234
"Your Honor, it's true.
We abetted in grand larceny."

399
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:45,785
Court, yes.

400
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:47,037
Well done, Watson.

401
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,872
What?
There was a trial.

402
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,207
When the first heist team
was arrested,

403
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,909
three of them
took plea bargains.

404
00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:54,828
But Carter Averill,
the organizer,

405
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,446
he tried his luck at trial.

406
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,581
All the details
of the original crime,

407
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,717
they were aired in court,
and no one knew exactly

408
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,802
how the foursome got
into The Leviathan,

409
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:04,170
but it's worth going
over the transcripts.

410
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,455
There would have been
expert witnesses,

411
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:06,956
summaries of fact,

412
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,475
someone could have
pieced together the solution.

413
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:10,894
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

414
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,646
Because I think the only reason
you're clinging

415
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,014
to this copycat theory

416
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:15,482
is because you couldn't
figure it out.

417
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:16,733
I'm playing the probabilities.

418
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:17,984
That's what I always do.

419
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:26,526
So, some priceless artifacts
just came into your possession,

420
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:30,413
and the fewer questions I have
about said artifacts the better.

421
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:31,647
Correct.

422
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:34,334
And this just happened
to be on the day

423
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,986
that you were looking
into Le Chevalier,

424
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:40,123
and this happens to be
the stuff that he stole.

425
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,825
And the culture will be grateful
for their return.

426
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:45,712
Mm-hmm.

427
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:47,663
Y-You're not leaving that?

428
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,832
Oh. (chuckles)

429
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,835
No, this is just something
I picked up for my place.

430
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:02,645
WATSON:
I'm not okay with this.

431
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,180
You don't like
where it's hanging?

432
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:07,951
You stole a $50
million painting.

433
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:10,203
I did not steal it;
I'm just delaying its return.

434
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:12,188
If I'm going to spend
the evening

435
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,541
reading court transcripts,
I might as well do it

436
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:17,026
in the company
of a masterpiece.

437
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:18,795
It really ties
the room together.

438
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:20,797
Well, you're gonna take
that back to the Aster Museum

439
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,749
(phone ringing)
first thing in the morning.

440
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,700
What's my phone doing up here?

441
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,870
(ringing continues)

442
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:29,539
Hey, Oren.

443
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,807
Joan.

444
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,209
I'm so excited to see you.

445
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:35,095
I miss you, sis.
I miss you, too,

446
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,896
but didn't Mom tell you
I'm on a job?

447
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,848
She did,
but I just got your text.

448
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,050
It said you're coming.
From me?

449
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,852
Yeah, you're coming to dinner.

450
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:44,387
You're bringing your client.
My client?

451
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:46,773
No, I... well...

452
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:49,109
Oh, come on, Joan.

453
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:50,276
Tell me you'll be there.

454
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,445
Uh, I... Yeah.

455
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,747
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

456
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:55,365
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

457
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:56,916
Okay. Love you.

458
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,734
Bye.

459
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:00,170
I put a lock code on here

460
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:01,755
to prevent you from
sending out texts.

461
00:20:01,757 --> 00:20:03,456
I was hired to breach
The Leviathan.

462
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,592
Do you think I wouldn't be able
to get into your phone?

463
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:07,210
Yeah, well, you're not
gonna meet my family.

464
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,578
Aren't I? I don't know.

465
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,463
I'm not sure I can be
without your company

466
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:12,748
for two hours tomorrow night.
Feeling a little relapse-y.

467
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,601
(gasps)
You're only using that word

468
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:16,269
because you know
that I can't leave you alone

469
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:17,587
if you say "relapse."

470
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:18,605
You just want to meet

471
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:19,606
my family so you can

472
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,024
put them under a microscope.

473
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:23,092
Nonsense. You search
your conscience, Watson.

474
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,227
If you're really comfortable

475
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:26,396
going out for dinner
while I dream

476
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,481
of chasing the dragon,
then so be it.

477
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:31,434
I have a transcript to read.

478
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,588
HOLMES:
<i>Good morning.</i>

479
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,123
<i>Coffee,</i>

480
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,159
yogurt, assorted fruits.

481
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,577
Thanks.

482
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,162
Seven minutes for you
to eat and drink,

483
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:44,047
23 minutes for you
to shower and get dressed,

484
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,715
should get us
to the property clerk's office

485
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,333
just as it opens.

486
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,469
Why are we going to the
property clerk's office?

487
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:51,120
That's where they keep
Exhibit C.

488
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:52,288
Exhibit C
from Carter Averill's trial.

489
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,789
I want to have a look at it.

490
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,675
The jury looked at it
three separate times

491
00:20:55,677 --> 00:20:57,477
while they were deliberating.

492
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,095
Well, isn't that what
the jury's supposed to do,

493
00:20:59,097 --> 00:21:00,346
look at the exhibits?

494
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,515
This is a scrap of paper

495
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:03,900
from the trash bag
that the thieves' landlord

496
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:05,151
gave to the police.

497
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:06,653
It's a simple,
handwritten note,

498
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:08,822
a scrawled coffee order
with the names of the criminals

499
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:10,806
written next to the drinks
that they wanted.

500
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:12,442
Apparently, they made
a Starbucks run

501
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:13,943
while they were planning
the heist.

502
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:16,312
So? Thieves drink coffee, too.

503
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,364
Not my point.
The prosecution used it to prove

504
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:20,366
that the four men
were working together.

505
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:23,002
After that's done, it's hardly
a trove of information, is it?

506
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:26,873
Why would the jury need to look
at a coffee order three times?

507
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,793
(sighs)

508
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:33,162
WATSON:
That looks like a coffee order.

509
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:35,348
Three of them ordered soy.
I'm surprised they were

510
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,767
so health-conscious.

511
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,602
That looks like something
your printer

512
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:42,021
spits out when it's trying
to test to see if it works.

513
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:43,673
It looks like sheer nonsense.

514
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:45,675
That's what it is supposed
to look like.

515
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:48,478
It's a programming language
called "Malbolge."

516
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,180
It was designed
to be impenetrable.

517
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:53,816
The language's creator named it
after the eighth circle of hell

518
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:55,752
in Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

519
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:57,203
Now, there are few people
in the world

520
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,354
who can even recognize Malbolge

521
00:21:58,356 --> 00:21:59,789
as anything other
than gibberish.

522
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,574
Fewer still
who can write software

523
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:03,076
using it.

524
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,410
I learned about the language

525
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:05,995
from a consultant
I used in London.

526
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:08,548
She should be able
to get us a translation soon.

527
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,584
The important thing is
it's a message.

528
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:14,087
It was hidden in plain sight
throughout the trial.

529
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:16,839
Do you think someone
from the jury recognized it?

530
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,709
Why else would they ask to see
a coffee order

531
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:21,344
again and again, hmm?

532
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:25,014
Here you are. Justin Guthrie.

533
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:26,816
Unemployed at the time
of the trial,

534
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:28,101
but listed
his previous occupation

535
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,719
as "software engineer."

536
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:33,439
Shall we see if he's familiar
with Malbolge?

537
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:35,775
So what do we do
if this guy Guthrie says

538
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,493
he doesn't know what
you're talking about?

539
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:39,028
We can start
by seeing

540
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,747
if he's got any
diamonds lying around.

541
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:43,499
(phone chimes)

542
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:45,201
That's it.

543
00:22:45,203 --> 00:22:48,237
They attacked the
random number generator.

544
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,757
That does not say,

545
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,542
"they attacked
the random number generator."

546
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:54,010
It's an algorithm,
Watson.

547
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:56,012
This is a translation
of the coded Malbolge,

548
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:58,214
sent by my contact
in London.

549
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:01,384
This is how
the first team

550
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:03,202
of thieves got into
The Leviathan.

551
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:05,571
The vault's software
is designed to spit out

552
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:08,591
ten random digits
every two minutes.

553
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:10,510
This makes it
impossible to predict

554
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:12,862
the access code at
any given moment.

555
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:15,815
The genius of the original
plan is this algorithm.

556
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:18,751
They hacked the software,
fed the equation into it.

557
00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,286
It spits out
escalating multiples

558
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:22,288
of the number pi
every two minutes.

559
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,589
Pi is infinite,

560
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:25,325
so if you take a
ten-digit sample,

561
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:26,942
the numbers still
appear random.

562
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:28,411
But if you know
the algorithm,

563
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:29,879
you can predict
the code.

564
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:31,947
Yes. Even after you leave,
it still looks like

565
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:34,334
the software is
functioning perfectly, hmm?

566
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:36,552
Justin Guthrie must have
translated the Malbolge,

567
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:39,172
realized that he had the key
for cracking The Leviathan.

568
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:40,673
Well, any Leviathan.

569
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:43,926
So, a guy on the jury
planned a $40-million heist?

570
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,628
Well, he had help,
obviously.

571
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,480
But that's exactly
what he did.

572
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:48,598
When you've eliminated
the impossible,

573
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,649
Watson, whatever
remains...

574
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:51,133
Yeah, you said
that already.

575
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:53,686
Officer, we need to get
into the building.

576
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:54,988
Sorry, pal, no can do.

577
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,472
This is an active
investigation.

578
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:57,940
Yes. I'm a consultant
with the NYPD,

579
00:23:57,942 --> 00:24:00,076
and I need to speak to
one of the tenants.

580
00:24:00,078 --> 00:24:01,361
His name is
Justin Guthrie.

581
00:24:01,363 --> 00:24:02,578
You said Guthrie?

582
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,980
Yes. Shall I spell
it for you? G...

583
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:06,416
No, but considering he's
the one we're here for,

584
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:07,950
you might want to talk
to one of the detectives.

585
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:09,869
Mr. Guthrie jumped out
the window

586
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:12,338
of his apartment
a little while ago.

587
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:24,826
(garbled radio transmission)

588
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:27,212
(light melody playing)

589
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:40,358
So the precinct detective says
this is a suicide,

590
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,146
but you think that he stole
$40 million in diamonds

591
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:46,981
and then got killed
behind it?

592
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:48,566
So what's the story?

593
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:51,469
(music stops)

594
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:55,173
Obviously, a violent
altercation took place.

595
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:57,242
Blood evidence.

596
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:01,746
Myself and Miss Watson
found it

597
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:04,332
and examined it closely.

598
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:09,036
Spatter pattern indicates
it's a high forced event.

599
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,257
He's saying the blood came from
someone who was hit in the nose.

600
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:14,542
Okay. It's worth
looking into.

601
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:16,761
I still don't see the connection
to that robbery.

602
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:19,347
I was just thinking about
that when you arrived.

603
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:22,233
The answer, of course,
lies in those vases.

604
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:28,106
These two has three layers
of decorative rock,

605
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,991
each one
a different color.

606
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:32,694
This one has two layers,

607
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,696
but the mineral residue
on the glass indicates

608
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:36,281
that it was full
till very recently.

609
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:37,949
Many of the stones stolen

610
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:40,285
from the Svalbard Exchange
were uncut diamonds.

611
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:43,338
They happen to look exactly
like decorative rocks.

612
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,573
Now, if you'd just stolen some,

613
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:48,126
this vase would be
an ideal hiding place.

614
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:50,545
I'm guessing that
whichever co-conspirator

615
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:53,247
just relieved Mr. Guthrie
of his share

616
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:54,966
of the diamonds
thought the same thing.

617
00:25:54,968 --> 00:25:56,851
He was, however,
in a hurry.

618
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:05,310
He might have missed one.

619
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:07,395
You're telling us
that's a...?

620
00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:08,897
Uncut diamond.

621
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,565
Let's get some more
detectives down here.

622
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:12,617
I want to start
a full-scale canvass.

623
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,372
Looks like we have
a murder on our hands.

624
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:20,291
Look, it's almost 6:00.

625
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,709
We have to start getting ready.

626
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:25,296
Oh, right.
Dinner with your family.

627
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:28,133
Well, as you said, this is now
a murder investigation.

628
00:26:28,135 --> 00:26:30,084
You'll understand
if I can't make it.

629
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,220
Absolutely.

630
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,792
HOLMES: <i>And I would never</i>
<i>have been able</i>

631
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:39,811
to prove that you
were a murderer.

632
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:41,062
(laughter)

633
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:42,597
Joan, you're here.
Excellent.

634
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,183
I was just telling your
family about my work.

635
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:46,467
Hi there.

636
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:49,270
This lovely young lady
is Gabrielle.

637
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:50,989
She's your brother's girlfriend;
soon, I expect, fiancÃ©e.

638
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:52,740
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

639
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,108
It's so nice
to meet you.

640
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,910
Oren talks about you all the time.
(chuckles)

641
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:57,245
(quietly):
What happened to,

642
00:26:57,247 --> 00:26:59,030
"this is a murder
investigation"?

643
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,332
In a bit of a lull
right now, actually.

644
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:02,417
We're awaiting
the results

645
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,118
of the DNA tests
on the blood.

646
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,754
And I saw a chance to spend
some time with your family,

647
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:08,456
and I took it.

648
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:12,126
Joan, is it true you helped
prove the CIO of Canon Ebersole

649
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:13,828
had a secretary who killed
five people?

650
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,464
Uh, not really.
I just helped out a little.

651
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:18,516
She was instrumental
in solving that case.

652
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:21,386
She also went to the trouble
of saving my life.

653
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:23,638
Quite a promising detective
in her own right.

654
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,139
I'm not a detective.

655
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:27,108
I just, I'm along for
the ride for a while.

656
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,726
You're being modest.

657
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:30,895
That's not the only case
she's helped me solve.

658
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:33,898
Hard to picture
what she does, isn't it?

659
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,182
"Sober companion."

660
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:37,118
When I first heard
that term,

661
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,687
I couldn't imagine what it
entailed, and I'm an addict.

662
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:42,490
(laughter)

663
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,792
She practices quite a
unique specialty, your daughter.

664
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,861
She rebuilds lives
from the ground up.

665
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:50,465
You can measure her success
in careers restored.

666
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:55,837
In my case, criminals
caught and in lives saved.

667
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,505
Interesting.

668
00:27:57,507 --> 00:27:59,591
Never thought of it like that.

669
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:00,875
Of course you haven't.

670
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:02,543
You've raised
a modest daughter.

671
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:03,811
She would never
say such a thing.

672
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,730
Shall we order?

673
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:10,217
I hear the rabbit
is a-ma-zing.

674
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:13,655
I know you're gonna
blow this off,

675
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:16,390
but I'm gonna say it
anyway: thank you.

676
00:28:16,392 --> 00:28:20,495
I've never been able to make
my family understand what I do.

677
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:23,865
Yes, well, I meant very
little of what I said.

678
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,200
There's the blowing-off part.

679
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,752
I know my audience.

680
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:33,091
I simply told them what
they wanted to hear.

681
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:34,626
They're nice people,
your family,

682
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:39,246
but they are, at their
core, conventional.

683
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:41,082
You make an effort to
appear conventional,

684
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:45,470
but I know, Watson, you share
my love of all that is bizarre

685
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:48,523
and outside the humdrum
routine of ordinary life.

686
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,642
Your family will never
understand this,

687
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:53,611
so I gave them some words
that they would understand.

688
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,317
What?

689
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,768
I'm just curious

690
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,937
as to who Justin Guthrie
might have collaborated with

691
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:04,739
to rob the
diamond exchange.

692
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,408
I've been sifting through
his phone in my downtime.

693
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,044
That's the dead guy's phone?
Isn't that evidence?

694
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:12,547
Yeah, well, I will give it
back when I'm finished.

695
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,667
He stored three phone numbers
in his notes section.

696
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:17,952
Each one has just a first name
next to it:

697
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:19,253
Jeremy, Amelie, Alex.

698
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:21,622
These are the names
of three people

699
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,641
with whom he served
on the jury.

700
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:25,393
So they kept in touch.

701
00:29:25,395 --> 00:29:27,645
Have you served
jury service?

702
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:29,764
Did you have
any desire

703
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:33,985
to see those people
again when it was over?

704
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:39,824
(opera music playing loudly)

705
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:42,610
It's 3:00 in the morning!

706
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:44,362
(volume decreases)

707
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:46,531
It's nearly finished.
Don't turn it down.

708
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:48,199
I'm basking.

709
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,483
(volume increases)

710
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:51,202
Can't you bask
in the morning?

711
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:52,286
(music stops)

712
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:54,488
It's this case, Watson.

713
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,125
It renews one's faith
in the profession.

714
00:29:57,127 --> 00:30:00,494
It's a life of boundless
surprises, detective work.

715
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:03,348
Do I have to find you
a drug test?

716
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,500
These are the four men who broke

717
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:08,836
into The Leviathan
in 2010.

718
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:11,189
Now, we've already met
Charles Briggs, lock-pick

719
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:12,807
and locksmith extraordinaire.

720
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,776
This is Vance Paulson.

721
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:16,711
He was the
inside man.

722
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,646
The late Carter Averill,

723
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:20,698
organizer of the crime,
genius.

724
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,400
He mastered everything from
computer coding

725
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:24,619
to surveillance software.

726
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:29,374
And, finally, David Retts,
PhD in electrical engineering.

727
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,193
Nothing about this is making me
want to bask.

728
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:33,711
I haven't got
to the good bit yet.

729
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,496
We already know

730
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:37,248
that Justin Guthrie's
programming skills

731
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,552
allowed him to perform much the
same function as Carter Averill.

732
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:44,872
Now let's meet
some of his fellow jurors.

733
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:49,560
Alex Wilson worked as
an electrical engineer

734
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:53,264
until his employer forced
early retirement on him.

735
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:54,599
Jeremy Lopez,

736
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:56,484
son of a locksmith.

737
00:30:56,486 --> 00:31:01,055
Paid his way through school
by plying his father's trade.

738
00:31:01,057 --> 00:31:03,574
So you're saying that Justin
Guthrie committed this robbery

739
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:05,193
with other members of the jury?

740
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:06,560
Probably started as a joke.

741
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:08,579
Jurors spend
a lot of time together.

742
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:10,331
Lots of idle chitchat, hmm?

743
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,067
They noted that between them,
they had the same skill set

744
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:15,369
as the thieves
they were trying.

745
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:17,755
Once Justin Guthrie spotted
the coded programming language,

746
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:19,340
things turned serious.

747
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:21,008
They realized
they'd been handed the recipe

748
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,409
for making millions of dollars.

749
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:25,663
So, who was the inside man?

750
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:27,882
This is Amelie Widomski,

751
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:30,685
a homemaker
from Roosevelt Island.

752
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:33,955
I couldn't make any sense
of it until I noticed

753
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:36,590
that she'd written her maiden
name on some paperwork.

754
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:39,227
Amelie Widomski was born
"Amelie Batonvert."

755
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:40,228
Green Stick.

756
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,429
The manager of

757
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:46,767
the Svalbard Diamond Exchange
is her brother.

758
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,270
Whether he was in on it
or whether she just used

759
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:51,706
the family connection to gain
access during working hours,

760
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,909
these are the four people
who robbed

761
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:57,111
the Svalbard Diamond Exchange
two days ago.

762
00:31:57,113 --> 00:32:01,282
And one of them is killing
the others to keep the proceeds.

763
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,117
GREGSON: Okay, ten jurors,
two alternates.

764
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,136
The only surviving juror
we couldn't find is Alex Wilson.

765
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:06,587
That's the engineer.

766
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:08,890
You think he has something
to do with this, right?

767
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,791
So, assuming you're right
about what happened,

768
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,310
he's probably in the wind.

769
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:14,145
Seems like
he could be our guy.

770
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:15,462
Maybe, but I believe

771
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:17,965
our killer is standing
in that room.

772
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,484
That man is named
Jeremy Lopez.

773
00:32:19,486 --> 00:32:21,969
Even from here, you can
see his face is injured.

774
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:23,470
You think Justin Guthrie
did that to him?

775
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:24,972
Should be easy enough
to find out.

776
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:26,324
(door opens)

777
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:28,809
Ladies and gentlemen, um,

778
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:31,662
so I'd like to start
by thanking you all

779
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:33,147
for fulfilling your civic duty.

780
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:36,534
The justice system called,
12 of you answered. Yes.

781
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:38,586
Unfortunately, it seems that

782
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:42,323
four of your number have become
criminals themselves,

783
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:43,991
and one of those four

784
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:46,377
is now a murderer.

785
00:32:47,662 --> 00:32:49,297
Shocking, I know.

786
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,282
But we have
obtained a sample

787
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:52,850
of the murderer's blood.

788
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:55,052
Now it's a simple case
of comparing your DNA

789
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:58,505
to that sample,
and we'll have our killer.

790
00:32:58,507 --> 00:33:01,442
Okay, you can start.

791
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,445
HOLMES:
Please, bear in mind,

792
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:06,647
we cannot force you
to give samples.

793
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,115
But you've already
demonstrated

794
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:09,867
your civic-mindedness
by serving as jurors,

795
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:12,787
and I'm sure that the innocent
amongst you will relish

796
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:14,688
the chance to help
catch a murderer.

797
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:16,991
If, however,
you recently

798
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:18,859
did murder Justin Guthrie,

799
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,078
you certainly should not
offer a sample.

800
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,696
Uh, that would be folly.

801
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:29,637
Everything all right, Mr. Lopez?

802
00:33:33,675 --> 00:33:36,060
Fine, fine.

803
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:38,879
All right, everyone,

804
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,097
you can go now.

805
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:42,149
Thank you very much
for your time.

806
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:51,242
We'll, uh, keep some people
on Lopez and Amelie Widomski,

807
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:53,077
make sure they
don't try to flee.

808
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,562
Maybe he gave us that sample
because he knew if he didn't,

809
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:57,564
we'd know it was him.
(scoffs)

810
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,784
I know. He seemed
pretty confident.

811
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:02,203
Why would a killer just
hand off his DNA like that?

812
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:03,287
I don't believe he would.

813
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:04,905
BELL:
Captain.

814
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:07,758
We just heard from an officer
in Irvington, New Jersey.

815
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,543
Guy saw our BOLO
on Alex Wilson.

816
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:11,963
This cop swears he saw Wilson
couple days ago.

817
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,514
Gave us an address.

818
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:15,099
We need to find him.

819
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:17,385
I may have been wrong
about Jeremy Lopez,

820
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,553
and I doubt Amelie Widomski
could throw a man

821
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:22,690
out of a window,
so if Lopez is not our man,

822
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:24,942
then Alex Wilson must be.

823
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:27,612
(knocks)

824
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:29,263
NYPD! Open up!

825
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:30,648
(knocks)

826
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,617
Let's go.
Open up or we're coming in.

827
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:35,602
(flies buzzing)

828
00:34:35,604 --> 00:34:38,489
Detective, uh,
I'm concerned there's no need

829
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:40,708
to look for Mr. Wilson inside.

830
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,609
Not with this many
coffin flies around.

831
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:44,111
Coffin flies?

832
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:47,748
Small, humpbacked members
of the Phoridae family.

833
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,333
They feed on decaying corpses.

834
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:51,502
They're congregating
on this cardboard.

835
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:54,972
(flies buzzing)

836
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:04,732
Looks like he's been
dead at least two days.

837
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:07,968
He didn't kill
Justin Guthrie yesterday.

838
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,478
Oh, good, you're back.

839
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,447
We just got the preliminary
DNA results

840
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:22,482
back from
Justin Guthrie's apartment.

841
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:26,403
It doesn't match Jeremy Lopez,
it doesn't match Alex Wilson.

842
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:30,707
It belongs to an Army chaplain
by the name of Audrey Higuerra.

843
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:33,043
What's her connection
to the jury?

844
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:35,295
As far as we know,
she doesn't have one.

845
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,830
HOLMES:
<i>Seems rather noble,</i>

846
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,165
this Audrey Higuerra,
doesn't she?

847
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,800
Very noble indeed.

848
00:35:40,802 --> 00:35:42,335
I don't like her.

849
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,304
Is that because she's a chaplain
or because she has

850
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:45,906
a "Habitat For Humanity" sticker
in her window?

851
00:35:45,908 --> 00:35:48,108
I don't like her
because she doesn't fit.

852
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,560
It was a beautiful theory,
not a hair out of place.

853
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:53,230
The first robbery, the team
of jurors-turned-criminals

854
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:55,899
who turned on each other
like a pack of rabid dogs.

855
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:57,550
But this Audrey
Higuerra--

856
00:35:57,552 --> 00:35:59,486
she doesn't have any
connection to these people.

857
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:01,321
She doesn't
fit anywhere.

858
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:04,140
Well, we found her blood in
Justin Guthrie's apartment.

859
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:05,692
And someone once said

860
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,327
once you've eliminated
the impossible,

861
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:10,063
whatever remains, no matter
how improbable, is the truth.

862
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:11,698
Sounds like a windbag.

863
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:15,869
I don't see anything here
that supports the idea

864
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,587
that she was
a murderer.

865
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:18,638
HOLMES:
Quite the opposite.

866
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,406
If I could attribute

867
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:24,878
three miracles to her, I would
nominate her for sainthood.

868
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,098
Yeah, looks like she's got the
caring for the sick part down.

869
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,851
She nursed her sister
through cancer.

870
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:36,089
So, not only is Audrey Higuerra
not to be found in her own home,

871
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:37,524
she's not even in the country.

872
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:39,192
We just found her calendar.

873
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:42,696
Turns out, she was deployed
to Kabul a couple weeks ago.

874
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:44,064
That can't be.

875
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:45,899
We just found a fresh
blood sample, hers,

876
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,450
in Justin Guthrie's
apartment yesterday.

877
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:49,202
We're waiting
on the Army to confirm

878
00:36:49,204 --> 00:36:51,037
that she's posted overseas,
but, I mean, look around.

879
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,323
Does it look like anyone's
been here recently?

880
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,958
Can I take back
everything I said

881
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,543
about eliminating
the impossible?

882
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:57,794
Why would you want to do that?

883
00:36:57,796 --> 00:36:58,745
Because Audrey Higuerra's sister

884
00:36:58,747 --> 00:36:59,996
died of leukemia.

885
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:02,465
And then once she was gone,
Audrey did

886
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,634
everything she could to help
people with the same disease.

887
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:06,786
I used to see this at the
hospital all the time.

888
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,722
They give them
to bone marrow donors.

889
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:12,058
HOLMES: Do you still
have a police detail

890
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,426
following Jeremy Lopez?

891
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:15,895
We called it off
when the DNA results came back.

892
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:18,732
You need to find him,
bring him in immediately.

893
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:28,307
I don't know
why I'm back here.

894
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:29,909
I already gave
you people my DNA.

895
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:31,828
Yeah, we had a little
problem with that.

896
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,997
Something went wrong
with one of the swabs.

897
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:37,650
If it's not too much trouble,
we'd like to get a blood sample.

898
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:39,336
It's a cleaner read.

899
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,487
I've already been very helpful.

900
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:42,789
Generous, even.

901
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,007
But, honestly,
I don't like needles.

902
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:45,675
I don't see why I should...

903
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:46,960
HOLMES:
There they are.

904
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:48,261
The evasions
and rhetorical curlicues

905
00:37:48,263 --> 00:37:49,796
of a man with something to hide.

906
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:51,181
I don't have anything to hide.

907
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:54,100
You had leukemia; is
that correct, Jeremy?

908
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:55,719
Yeah. Five years ago.

909
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:57,170
I'm better now.
Good.

910
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:58,271
And you're better because of

911
00:37:58,273 --> 00:37:59,839
a bone marrow
transplant, right?

912
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:02,325
Did you know that one
of the side effects

913
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:05,362
of a bone marrow transplant
is that your body

914
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:08,398
begins to manufacture cells
that bear the DNA of your donor?

915
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,849
Right.

916
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:11,401
And bone marrow
manufactures blood.

917
00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:14,287
So you know that every
recipient of a transplant

918
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:16,156
walks around with the
DNA of their donor

919
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:17,707
coursing through
their veins.

920
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:22,045
But the DNA in your skin,
your hair, your saliva,

921
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:24,381
that's all your own.

922
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,883
The blood that we found at
Justin Guthrie's apartment,

923
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:29,386
it bears the DNA
of Audrey Higuerra,

924
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:31,221
but it came
from your body.

925
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:33,807
You knew that you could
give us a saliva sample,

926
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,842
because the DNA
wouldn't match the blood

927
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:37,644
that we found at
the crime scene.

928
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:43,049
I cannot believe that you are
dragging my illness into this.

929
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:46,486
You stole $40 million, and then
you murdered two people.

930
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:49,689
I'm leaving.

931
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:50,857
Don't call me.

932
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,192
Don't expect me
to cooperate.

933
00:38:52,194 --> 00:38:55,695
Oh, we don't need
your cooperation.

934
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:59,199
What's that?

935
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,450
Court order.

936
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:03,086
Compels you to give us
a blood sample.

937
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:04,237
HOLMES:
We neglected to mention

938
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,205
that we had that

939
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:06,372
when we first came in.

940
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:07,424
Yes.

941
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:09,008
Well, we just didn't want

942
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,461
to deny ourselves the pleasure
of watching you squirm.

943
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:13,763
You give us
enough to arrest

944
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:17,050
Amelie Widomski for her part
in the robbery, and who knows?

945
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:21,054
Maybe a parole board
will see you before you're dead.

946
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:32,098
Such a shame.

947
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,034
Those bottles cost $500 apiece.

948
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:37,403
You'd think if they wanted
to thank me with champagne,

949
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:41,825
they'd go to the trouble
of finding out if I drink first.

950
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:43,776
Have a glass if you like.

951
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:46,779
You figured out Audrey Higuerra
was a bone marrow donor.

952
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:49,415
Pretty sure that's
not a good idea.

953
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:52,051
Is the smell
gonna bother you?

954
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:56,890
I suppose being proven right
is the best gift of all.

955
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:57,891
Hmm.

956
00:39:57,893 --> 00:39:59,225
There was no genius

957
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,678
who independently
cracked The Leviathan.

958
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,063
It was a question
of copying the original team.

959
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,298
Ah.

960
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,850
So that means you still might be

961
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,434
the smartest person
in the world.

962
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:09,802
I would never suggest that.

963
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:11,137
Really?

964
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:12,739
I think that's the first time

965
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,657
I've ever heard you say
anything remotely modest.

966
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:16,292
It's not modesty.

967
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:18,778
There's just no reliable way
to test the hypothesis.

968
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,363
(doorbell rings)

969
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:23,316
Triplets?

970
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:34,427
Mom?

971
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:36,513
I know I'm not
supposed to come see you

972
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,264
while you're out on a job,

973
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:40,683
but you did give me your card
the other night.

974
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,769
I was hoping
to talk to my daughter.

975
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:44,503
HOLMES:
Mm, please, come in.

976
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:47,941
Thank you.

977
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:51,177
I'll leave you
two to chat.

978
00:40:54,982 --> 00:40:58,785
It's, uh... nice.

979
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:00,570
I've never seen
anything like it,

980
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:04,490
but it seems like, uh,
it suits your client.

981
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:07,076
So, you just wanted to come over
here to see where I'm staying?

982
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:11,331
I know you think that I
don't like your new career.

983
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,833
To put it mildly.

984
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,501
You're right, I don't like it.

985
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:18,538
But not for the reasons
that you think.

986
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,557
I'm not happy
that you're a sober companion

987
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,541
because it never seems
to make you happy.

988
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:24,761
How do you know
what makes me happy?

989
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:27,513
I know because
you're my daughter.

990
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,735
(sighs)

991
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:38,992
After you left medicine,
after what happened with Liam,

992
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:40,994
I've always thought
that this job

993
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:44,914
was something that
you picked out of...

994
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,667
I don't know, out
of a sense of duty.

995
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:50,403
When you came to dinner
the other night,

996
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:53,089
when the two of you talked
about Sherlock's work,

997
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:57,176
I saw something
in you.

998
00:41:57,178 --> 00:41:59,262
There was a spark.

999
00:41:59,264 --> 00:42:01,764
A sense of
excitement.

1000
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:04,467
I haven't seen that
in you in a long time.

1001
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:07,586
You like
what he does.

1002
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:10,607
Yes, okay, I enjoy it.

1003
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:12,942
But I'm not a detective, Mom.

1004
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:14,527
And I'm almost done
working with Sherlock,

1005
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:16,145
and then it's on
to another client.

1006
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,731
Will the next client
make you happy?

1007
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:24,437
People find their paths
in the strangest of ways.

1008
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,790
So sorry to interrupt.

1009
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:29,075
I've just, I've seen

1010
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:30,827
the most incredible thing
on the news.

1011
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:32,962
I'm quite sure
you'd want to see it.

1012
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:34,664
REPORTER: The police
are puzzled by the sudden

1013
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,249
and unexplained return

1014
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:38,801
of Vincent Van Gogh's
masterpiece, <i>PietÃ .</i>

1015
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,453
It was delivered
by courier to the head

1016
00:42:40,455 --> 00:42:42,588
of the Aster Museum
of Modern Art.

1017
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,391
The NYPD is speculating
that the thief must have been

1018
00:42:45,393 --> 00:42:46,693
suffering from
a guilty conscience,

1019
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,794
but the exact motive
for the return

1020
00:42:48,796 --> 00:42:50,980
remains a mystery.
