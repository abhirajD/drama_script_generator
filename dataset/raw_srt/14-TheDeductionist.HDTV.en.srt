You ready to get
into the act?

4

I thought you'd never ask.

5

What's this? Intermission?

This is the part
where we take your stuff.

7

We're robbing you.

8

Well, I don't suppose
you could finish the show first.

9

How much money do you
keep in the house?

10
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,492
Never been robbed by people
in their underwear before.

Well, no. Was one chap,

00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:11,162
much prettier.

13

You want to do this

Fine.

15

You know,

16
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:18,503
I'd heard rumors

17
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,121
of two prostitutes

18
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:22,457
who bind innocent whoremongers
and then rob them.

19
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,460
But to think that those
two women ended up in my home

20
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,161
on-on this very evening...

21
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:29,497
I suppose
I should thank you.

22
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:32,300
I usually investigate crimes
of a more... homicidal nature,

23
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,469
but it's been an uneventful

24
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,471
few days.

25
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:37,805
Gentlemen!

26
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,480
Just one question

27
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,532
Can I keep these?

28
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:57,325
I'm glad your bust
was such a success last night,

29
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,160
but this place still
smells like stripper.

30
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,545
Does it?

31
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:01,879
Yeah.

What's with the sword?

33
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:04,999
It's not a sword,
it's a singlestick.

34
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,034
Well, it looks like a sword.

35
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:08,386
In sword sports,

36
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:10,471
virtually the entire body
is a target.

37

In singlestick,

plant their feet

So, your docket's

Sadly, yes.

throwing parties

47
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,391
or something.

48
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:31,826
I confess, Watson.

49
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:33,327
I find your insistence

50
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,745
on maintaining your
own residence puzzling.

51
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:36,397
Hmm? As a live-in
sobriety counselor,

52
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,732
you could, in theory,
live rent-free

00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:41,235
in the most expensive city
in the world indefinitely.

Why not embrace the fact

55

that you are a professional
nomad and give the place up?

'Cause I love my apartment.
It's my sanctum sanctorum.

When I get a job,
I sublet it,

Once you're inside,

We'll remove one kidney,

three doctors and a

It's ridiculous to give the man

Ennis got the drop
on them somehow.

118
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,520
He pulled the IV line

119
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,990
intended to deliver the general
anesthetic out of his vein.

120
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,775
It pooled up beneath
the surface of his skin

instead of putting him to sleep.

122

He then slowed his heart rate

123
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:18,830
by practiced meditation
to fool the machines.

How could you
possibly know that?

127
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,288
Bloodstain.

128
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,739
Might as well
have a flashing arrow

129
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,374

130
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,076
There's blood everywhere,
of course, but...

131
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,012
this stain
is of particular interest.

132
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:38,016
It's clearly been diluted
with some other agent.

Chemical.

134

What's the most common

135

Propofol.

136
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:45,853
Propofol. I'll wager
we'll find that here.

137
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,926
This stain was created
when he yanked

138
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,228
<i>the IV from his arm.</i>

139
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,897
The heart rate?
The pulse? What...?

140
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,816
It's common knowledge,
the fakirs of Bangladesh

141
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:57,202
can meditate
their circulatory systems

to a virtual standstill.

143
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,740
This man was
shot in the head

144

so that his scrubs wouldn't
be stained with blood.

145
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,046
He took them, pointed his stolen
gun at whoever he needed to,

146
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,781
walked out the front door.

147
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,949
That's <i>how</i> he left.

148
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,552
I would certainly like to
know where Ennis is going,

149
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,172
and what he intends to do
with his newfound freedom.

150
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:20,458
Not sure if this
is going to be any help. Yo.

151
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,296

"Shedir."

153
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,638
It's a star.
The traditional name

the southernmost star
of the Cassiopeia constellation.

156
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,811
No clue what

157
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,246
he's trying to tell us,

158
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,531
but our partners
are chewing on it.

159
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,533
Partners?

160
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:47,485
It's a serial case.

161
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,954
The FBI is here, too.

as well as any suspect
I've pursued.

164
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,127
What's she doing here?

165
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,214
She's the profiler who nailed
Ennis the first time around.

166
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:00,882
Kathryn Drummond.

167
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,166
Makes sense that
the Bureau wants her

168
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,551
to run point for them.

169
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,020
Captain, call for you.

170
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,057
You know her?
We worked together when

171
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:11,509
an American serial killer
came to London.

172
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,728
She's a buffoon.
All profilers are.

173
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,647
They're snake oil salesmen

174
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,782
who cast maladjusted
closet cases

175
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,784
as criminal geniuses
in the media.

176
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,653
The profilers, in turn,
can be super-geniuses

177
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,905
when the killers
are caught.

178
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:25,790
Isn't profiling part
of what you do?

179
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,959
I deduce.
Enormous difference.

180
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,527
Holmes.

181
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,464
Glad to see you landed
on your feet in New York.

182
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,300
I heard you had some
difficulties in London.

183
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,201
Nice to see you're
keeping tabs on me.

184
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,471
Yes. This is Joan Watson.
She accompanies me.

185
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,038
Helps keep those difficulties
from reoccurring.

186
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,374
Nice to meet you.
And you.

187
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,893
We are talking
about heroin, right?

188
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,145
Where's your captain?

189
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,596
I need the manpower to do

190
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:49,848
a four-quadrant search
of the neighborhood.

191
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,183
Did you know
that Patricia Ennis,

192
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,719
Howard Ennis's sister,
is a patient here?

193
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,855
Why not talk
to her first?

194
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,690
She was the one he was
ostensibly here to help,

195
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,725
so maybe she has some insight
as to where he's gone.

196
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,660
Oh, no. Wait.

197
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,563
Your book, that's right.
What was it called?

198
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,231
<i>Profiles in Terror.</i>

199
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,001
Yes, Ms. Drummond
wrote a book

200
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,453
about Howard Ennis
after she caught him.

201
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,904
Got into a spot of bother

202
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,539
when she speculated
about the sexual abuse

203
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,907
he must surely have suffered

204
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,175
at the hands
of his parents,

205
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,676
because they said
it was a lie.

206
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,961
Sued you for libel,

207
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,097
correct?
That got thrown out of court.

208
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,133
Nice to meet you.

209
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,471
This never would have
happened if...

210
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:32,640
if I hadn't gotten
Howard out of prison.

211
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:33,892
It's not your fault.

212
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,227
No, but after I got sick,

213
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,896
I asked the doctor

214
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:41,082
if there was
any other way.

215
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,769
I didn't want any part
of him inside of me.

216
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,437
But the waiting list

217
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,773
for the transplant
was so long.

218
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,575
The-the doctor
said that a...

219
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,044
a sibling would be
the best match.

220
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,229
Do you have any idea

221
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:55,663
where your brother
might have gone?

222
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,882
Until I asked him
for the kidney, we hadn't

223
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,618
spoken in years.

224
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,420
I have some letters
that he wrote me.

225
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,255
I could give you those
if you want.

226
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,840
Yes, that
would be very helpful.

227
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,959
Thank you.

228
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,348
Is she gonna be part
of the investigation?

229
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,066
She is, but you

230
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,067
won't have to...

231
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,269
So glad she's helping.

232
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,321
Howard needs to be stopped.

233
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,691
She did it once,
she can do it again.

234
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,281
Hi, Bruce.

235
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,750
Let me guess:

236
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,619
The air valve's making
that whistling sound again?

237
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,789
You know how this old radiator
gets in the winter.

238
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,091
Yeah, well,
when I hear it,

239
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,544
I know I'm home.

240
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,966
You know the Conklins
up on three?

241
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,333
Yeah, of course.

242
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,502
Their son's a
teenager now.

243
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,005
He went to certain...

244
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,640
Web pages.

245
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,560
So Mrs. Conklin
learns about it.

246
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,011
Checks the
search history

247
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,680
to see what her boy's
been exposed to.

248
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,649
She found a pornographic film

249
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,818
that was made right here,

250
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,069
in this apartment.

251
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:09,621
What are you talking about?

252
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,624
The guy you sublet the
apartment to-- Cooper?

253
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,293
He's been shooting
pornography here.

254
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,752
Hi.

255
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,838
I take it your meeting
did not go well.

256
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,706
You haven't asked
why I'm lying on the table.

257
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,508
You are clearly distracted.

258
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,144
My subletter filmed
a pornographic movie

259
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,213
in my apartment, so now
I'm getting evicted.

260
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,683
Well, I suppose now you can do
as I suggested:

261
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,652
live as a wandering nomad
of sobriety.

262
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,021
I don't want to be a
wandering nomad of sobriety.

263
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,722
I want my own space.

264
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,963
Well, perhaps I could
help you reclaim it.

265
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:46,725
No.

266
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,559
I mean...

267
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,028
I appreciate it;
it's just that

268
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,863
I want my apartment
the way it was before

269
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,449
it was... violated.

270
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,701
Yeah, I-I saw some of the
movie while I was there.

271
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,620
I don't think I could
live there again.

272
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,908
Why are you lying
on the table?

273
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,877
I'm looking at the stars.

274
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,414
That's Cassiopeia,

275
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,584
oriented as it appears now
in the night sky.

276
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:17,421
It fits precisely into a map
of Manhattan of that scale.

277
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,391
The first "X" is Shedir,
the first star.

278
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,060
Site of this morning's murders
in Greenwich Village.

279
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,261
That would put the second star
in Turtle Bay,

280
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,597
somewhere near the U.N;
the third star, Columbus Circle.

281
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,199
You get the idea.
This is a map

282
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,567
of where Ennis plans
to kill people.

283
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,202
This is important.

284
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,537
Did you tell anyone yet?

285
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,938
They're all very excited.

286
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,374
Resources being reallocated
as we speak.

287
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,775
Trouble is,

288
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,210
I think it's all bollocks.

289
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,912
Wait, you think you're wrong?

290
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:44,215
I think I cracked a code
that was intended to be cracked.

291
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,783
I think

292
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,618
he wants the police
directing resources

293
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,338
to these locations so he can,
I don't know, watch them.

294
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,057
Like mice running a maze
of his own design.

295
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,926
Oh, speaking of vermin.

296
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,428
What is it with you

297
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,097
and that woman?

298
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,432
It's obviously more
than just hating profilers.

299
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,102
If you're asking if we had sex,
the answer is yes, obviously.

300
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,138
Oh, so she's an ex?

301
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,773
More like a "C," C-plus at best.

302
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,858
We had an arrangement
while she was in London,

303
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,243
similar to the arrangement

304
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,112
I have with other women
here in New York.

305
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,980
We performed the act of love
loudly and repeatedly,

306
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,366
without any actual love,
or even any like.

307
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:20,651
I would describe it as an act
of self-love were it not

308
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,723
for the fact that she
was technically present.

309
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:22,705
I get it.

310
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,622
Now I would just prefer her
not to send

311
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,384
the police on an ego-driven
wild goose chase.

312
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,377
We updated the profile

313
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:30,962
to reflect our
latest thinking.

314
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:33,164
Captain, I know Ms. Drummond
is entitled to her say,

315
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,882
but before you imbibe
any profiling snake oil,

316
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,500
I would like to offer
my own assessment.

317
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,802
We're in the middle
of a meeting here.

318
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,304
Cassiopeia code
is certainly alluring.

319
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,106
Perhaps too alluring.

320
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,808
Howard Ennis
is not a spree killer.

321
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,777
I believe he is trying
to distract us.

322
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,178
He'll lie low, he'll
change his appearance,

323
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,147
but eventually,
he will pick up a blade,

324
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,848
and he will find
another young blonde.

325
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,784
Is that it?

326
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:56,187
Ms. Drummond's
latest profile.

327
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,740
Basically, it says
what you just said.

328
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:01,826
Ennis had to know
we'd break the code.

329
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,028
I didn't know you were capable
of that level of thinking,

330
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,863
but you have been exposed
to my methods, so...

331
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,031
I-I don't know what's

332
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,532
going on between you two,

333
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,534
but the important thing
to me is that

334
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,470
my top consultant
and the Bureau's top profiler

335
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,722
agree with each other.

336
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,093
The Public Employees Federation

337
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,929
sued the state...

338
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,098
... it argues that
the Health Department

339
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,633
overstepped its authority

340
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:28,036
by forcing employees
to be vaccinated

341
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:30,238
by November 30.

342
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,060
The Health Department
says it will fight...

343
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,738
Oh, God! Please...

344
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,524
Please... don't...

345
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:52,576
Will you do me a favor?

346
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,296
Would you mind taking

347
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:57,048
my picture with
your phone?

348
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,143
He walked into the store
and shot everyone here

349
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:20,509
except for the
one person

350
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:23,946
that actually fits
his victim profile.

351
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,165
You two said he
would lie low.

352
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,200
Change his appearance.

353
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:29,702
Is this what you call lying low?

354
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:31,286
I confess,
a crime like this

355
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:33,288
is out of character
for Howard Ennis.

356
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,325
But it doesn't invalidate
anything I wrote in my report.

357
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,661
The register was robbed.

358
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:39,962
Stands to reason

359
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:42,031
Howard Ennis would have
varied his routine

360
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,899
because he needed cash
to get out of town.

361
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,684
Poppycock.
Excuse me?

362
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:47,052
Poppycock.

363
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:48,587
The desperate rhetorical
contortions of someone

364
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,922
with a pathological
need to be right.

365
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:53,058
Same old Sherlock Holmes.

366
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,259
Look around you.

367
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:56,228
Howard Ennis,
despite his many flaws,

368
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,730
is not a complete moron.

369
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:58,930
If money had been his goal,

370
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:00,432
why would he rob
a place like this?

371
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,317
What's the most he could
have gotten away with?

372
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,603
$200, maybe $300?
Doesn't take much to go on the lam.

373
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,405
Then explain
his decision to leave

374
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:07,906
that woman alive.

375
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:09,107
You can't, can you?

376
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:10,109
'Cause you and I
both know

377
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,160
that her
crossing his path

378
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:12,378
was like
a piece of chum

379
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,546
crossing the path
of a ravenous shark.

380
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:15,831
You think he's sending
a message?

381
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,216
I do.

382
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:20,285
I just don't know
what it is.

383
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:28,960
You told me you were a
documentary filmmaker.

384
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,596
Bruce talked to you.

385
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:33,348
No, Cooper, I just watch
a ton of porn.

386
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,467
Imagine my surprise
when I saw a bunch of people

387
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,603
having sex in my living room,
on my couch.

388
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:39,021
Okay, you're angry.

389
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,407
You totally should be.
You think?

390
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:43,308
Look, for what it's worth,
I really did want

391
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,444
to make a movie about
child soldiers in the Sudan.

392
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,479
But, what, a bunch
of porn actors broke in here

393
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:49,198
and forced you
to film them instead?

394
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,916
I needed the money.

395
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:53,118
I-I couldn't get anyone
to invest in the documentary,

396
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,654
so I had to turn back
to alternative filmmaking

397
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,155
to pay the rent.

398
00:18:57,157 --> 00:18:58,874
Wait a second,
what do you mean, "turn back"?

399
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,158
You mean you made other "films"?

400
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,094
Not here.

401
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,712
But yeah.

402
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:04,996
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:06,215
Joan, seriously,
if I had the money,

404
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:07,266
I would have shot it

405
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:08,333
anywhere but here.

406
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,601
Man, did this
get screwed up!

407
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,002
After you took

408
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:12,554
the apartment back,
I was gonna ask you out!

409
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:21,230
How did it go
with your friend the auteur?

410
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:23,849
Didn't talk you
into a sequel, did he?

411
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,400
He's not my friend.

412
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,352
And he's getting kicked out,
same as me.

413
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:28,353
How's it going here?

414
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:30,072
Poorly.

415
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:32,157
I detached myself from the
Ennis manhunt several hours ago.

416
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,910
I thought I could be
more use to the police here.

417
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,962
Trying to decipher his game.

418
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:38,029
I was wrong.

419
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:42,968
That's mature.

420
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,169
Started out as a

421
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:46,338
simple mustache,
if you can believe it.

422
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,091
I know why you
don't like her.

423
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:52,043
You recall my aversion
to bile-spewing

424
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:53,278
pig-women?

425
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,263
"The Deductionist."

426
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:56,265
An article she wrote

427
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:59,301
for a psychiatric
journal ten years ago,

428
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:00,552
about a police consultant
she met

429
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:02,187
while on assignment in London.

430
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:03,722
A man she said was
"in possession

431
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:06,241
of a uniquely potent
deductive mind."

432
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,529
You seem genuinely
upset by her today.

433
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:13,398
So, I Googled her,
and I found the article.

434
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,368
She never referred to
you by name, but still,

435
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,669
some of the things
that she wrote...

436
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:19,237
When I first met
Kathryn Drummond,

437
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,673
she showed a modicum
of potential as an investigator.

438
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:24,626
So, aside from our
extracurricular exertions,

439
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:27,245
I tried to tutor her
in my methods.

440
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,381
She seemed quite amenable,
at the time.

441
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:31,683
Little did I know she was merely
interested in gaining

442
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:35,304
a better understanding of
the inner workings of my mind.

443
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:36,722
She was profiling you.

444
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:39,257
Well, that's one word
for it, yes.

445
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,527
Discovering the betrayal
was one thing;

446
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:43,061
discovering that she
was far more perceptive

447
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:45,364
than I realized
was quite another.

448
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,865
She predicted my struggles
with addiction.

449
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:49,935
She saw it coming; I did not.

450
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:51,904
Is that what this is all about?

451
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:54,573
The fact that she...
she got one thing right?

452
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,825
It was, as you will recall
from the piece,

453
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:59,277
one of several quite
alarming prognostications

454
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,330
she made regarding my future.

455
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:04,082
One of several methods
by which I might self-destruct.

456
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,718
And if she was right
about one...

457
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,171
well...

458
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,558
<i>We got a city in panic.</i>

459
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,010
We got seven dead bodies
in the morgue.

460
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,895
Now, I know my guys are

461
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:18,296
everything they can
to find Howard Ennis.

462
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:20,432
And you're
the so-called

463
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:21,850
Howard Ennis expert.

464
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,435
You don't seem to have
the first clue

465
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:24,853
what he's up to next.
I admit,

466
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:26,638
Howard Ennis's behavior
up to this point

467
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,607
has been perplexing.

468
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:30,192
It contradicts

469
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:32,444
everything I've come
to know about the man.

470
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:34,529
Maybe the chaos is the point.

471
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:37,082
The randomness,

472
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:38,817
the deliberate
flouting

473
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,285
of his profile.

474
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,287
Maybe he wants to confuse you.

475
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:43,922
Ms. Watson has
a point, Captain.

476
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,457
Yesterday, I posited that Ennis

477
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,259
was attempting
to send us a message.

478
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:50,429
Today, I would posit that
the confusion is the message.

479
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:52,547
Captain, it's Ennis.

480
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:54,266
He just called
the station, asked

481
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:56,501
to speak to the person in
charge of the task force.

482
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:58,186
I got him on hold
in your office.

483
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,774
This is Captain Gregson
of the NYPD.

484
00:22:02,776 --> 00:22:05,811
Hello, Captain Gregson
of the NYPD.

485
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:07,512
This is Howard Ennis.

486
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,781
May I assume that my old friend

487
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:11,516
Ms. Drummond is listening in?

488
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:13,352
Say your piece, Mr. Ennis.

489
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:15,454
I'll take that as a yes.

490
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:19,074
I saw you on the news
yesterday, Kathryn.

491
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:22,193
You are not aging well.

492
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:25,414
I'm calling because I thought
it was time

493
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,299
that I explained what I'm up to.

494
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:29,200
Actually, Mr. Ennis,
that won't be necessary.

495
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:30,201
Excuse me?

496
00:22:30,203 --> 00:22:32,638
Well, I just figured it out.

497
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,590
This is entirely
about Ms. Drummond, correct?

498
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,142
You despise her.

499
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:39,645
Why? Well, obvious answer
is that she's the agent

500
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:41,013
most responsible
for your capture,

501
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:43,315
but I think there's more
to it than that.

502
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:46,718
You detest her because she...
solved you.

503
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,353
She climbed inside your head,

504
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:50,221
she pulled all
your ugly secrets out

505
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:51,556
and exposed them.

506
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:53,224
She demystified you.

507
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:56,061
And now you're doing everything
in your power to...

508
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:58,997
violate her profile of you,
rail against it,

509
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:03,835
show everyone that, well,
you never really were solved.

510
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:06,538
I like you.

511
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,407
I know who you are.

512
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,710
The Deductionist.

513
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:14,012
Accent gave you away.

514
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:16,631
You see, I did a lot
of reading in prison.

515
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:19,051
I, uh, found everything
Kathryn ever wrote.

516
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:22,054
And, by the way, you're right.

517
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:25,390
I do want to humiliate Kathryn.

518
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:29,094
But not because
of what she did to me.

519
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:32,314
Because of what she did
to my family.

520
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:34,316
Family? Are you
serious, Howard?

521
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:37,736
Didn't you just abandon your
dying sister in a hospital?

522
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:41,940
My father was a good man.

523
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:44,876
Wasn't his fault
that I ended up the way I did.

524
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:46,661
But you, Kathryn...

525
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:51,416
you alleged that he abused me
on a regular basis,

526
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:54,419
that he made me into the man
that I am today.

527
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:56,254
You know as
well as I know

528
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:59,257
that there were multiple
allegations of abuse.

529
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:02,094
My father, as most
of you probably know,

530
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:06,798
hung himself in his garage a few
months after the book came out.

531
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:11,436
My mother never really
got over it.

532
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:14,239
She died less than a year later.

533
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:16,625
If you ask me, Kathryn,

534
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:20,195
you all but put a gun
to their heads.

535
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:25,483
You want me to stop doing
what I'm doing,

536
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:27,619
Captain Gregson of the NYPD?

537
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:30,322
All you have

538
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:32,324
to do...

539
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:35,460
is give me Kathryn Drummond.

540
00:24:38,465 --> 00:24:41,516
I think his demands
are quite reasonable.

541
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:05,664
A wall of newspaper clippings.

542
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:09,201
Journals filled
with his innermost inanities.

543
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:12,171
Souvenirs from the women
he murdered.

544
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:15,758
Ennis seems resolved
to leave no cliché unturned.

545
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,377
So we're no closer to finding
him than we were an hour ago.

546
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:20,212
I'm not so sure about that.

547
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:21,647
Standing inside

548
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:23,349
this space is like standing

549
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:25,550
inside Howard Ennis's brain.

550
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:27,770
It's hard to imagine there isn't
something of value here.

551
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:29,855
Actually, it's quite easy
to imagine.

552
00:25:29,857 --> 00:25:31,857
He let us find
this place.

553
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:33,442
He left his cell phone here

554
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:34,860
so we could
triangulate its signal.

555
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:36,779
Why? 'Cause he's making a point.

556
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:40,232
This room represents who he was,
not who he is.

557
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:41,733
If there was anything
of value here,

558
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,402
Ennis never would
have led us to it.

559
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,570
Were you not listening
when I explained his plan

560
00:25:45,572 --> 00:25:47,539
to become profile-proof?

561
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:55,514
Just out of curiosity,

562
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:57,516
how accurate were
your allegations

563
00:25:57,518 --> 00:25:59,518
against the Ennis family?

564
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,521
The first allegations of sexual
abuse came in your profile,

565
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:04,306
but that was just
pure speculation.

566
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:06,091
Your book, on
the other hand,

567
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:08,694
you quoted an anonymous
source, a neighbor who claimed

568
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:11,096
that Ennis had confided
in him about the abuses.

569
00:26:11,098 --> 00:26:13,098
So? What are you saying?

570
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,401
Well, I'm saying that you've
been known to cut corners.

571
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:17,486
In the article you wrote
about me, for example,

572
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,771
you included things that I
had said to you privately

573
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,707
as though they were
quotes for attribution.

574
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,108
You did say them, though.

575
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,910
And my article was right
about you.

576
00:26:24,912 --> 00:26:26,045
So far.

577
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:27,779
So, was there a neighbor?

578
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,999
Or were you just guessing about
Ennis being sexually abused?

579
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:32,617
Ennis's pathology was consistent
with sexual abuse.

580
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,453
I've chased men like him
for 20 years.

581
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:35,838
It's been present
every single time.

582
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,622
Doesn't mean
it was present here.

583
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:39,725
So, if you were wrong,
it was a costly mistake.

584
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:42,294
Ennis's father quoted your
book in his suicide note.

585
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:44,763
You spurred Howard to
eight murders and counting.

586
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:46,932
Oh, like Howard Ennis needs
a reason to kill people.

587
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,901
Maybe he doesn't, but he
didn't have this reason

588
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,769
until you came along.

589
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:53,472
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

590
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:56,308
You need anything?

591
00:26:57,944 --> 00:27:01,747
I know that Kathryn Drummond
is obsessed with her work.

592
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:07,736
She prides herself on the...
accuracy of her profiles.

593
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:11,740
But to think she would've gone
so far as to destroy a family

594
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:13,842
to lend credence
to one of her claims.

595
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:17,096
Did you ever consider
the possibility

596
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:18,931
that she lied about you
in the article?

597
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:20,665
What would she have to gain?

598
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,968
I was never revealed as
the subject in the article.

599
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,169
No one ever compared me

600
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:26,772
to it.

601
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:30,275
Anyway, she got
a good deal right.

602
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:32,394
She predicted your drug problem.
So what?

603
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:34,646
You got clean.
You picked up

604
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:36,281
your career
right where you left off.

605
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,950
And you even made a friend,

606
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,952
something that Kathryn
claimed in her article

607
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:42,471
was virtually
impossible.

608
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,689
Me.

609
00:27:46,192 --> 00:27:47,692
I'm talking about me.

610
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:50,145
Look, my point
is that...

611
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:52,531
the only thing
that anyone can predict

612
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:55,667
about people with 100% certainty
is that they'll change.

613
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:57,686
And anyone
who thinks otherwise

614
00:27:57,688 --> 00:27:59,722
is kidding themselves.

615
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,708
Oh, my God. Is that...

616
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,043
You have a lovely
home, Watson.

617
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,478
Excellent light.

618
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,980
I found today quite taxing.

619
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:09,431
I thought your pornography
might distract me.

620
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:11,316
It's not my pornography.

621
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:14,719
The sex, I'm sorry to say,
is quite mundane.

622
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,489
And even if it wasn't,
the continuity gaffes

623
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:19,224
make it virtually
unwatchable.

624
00:28:19,226 --> 00:28:21,276
What are you talking about?

625
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:27,666
Note the clock.

626
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:28,900
11:20 here.

627
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:32,371
1:00 there.

628
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:35,374
11:20 again. And many others.

629
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,876
If I were you, I wouldn't
be upset that a dirty movie

630
00:28:37,878 --> 00:28:39,795
was produced in my home;
I would be upset

631
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:41,880
that it was produced
so sloppily.

632
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:47,252
And if you haven't already,
I strongly recommend

633
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:50,305
that you find yourself
a new spatula.

634
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:05,937
<i>Watson!</i>

635
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:09,541
Morning.
What is it?

636
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:11,610
Captain Gregson just texted,
said there was some sort

637
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:14,213
of disturbance at Patricia
Ennis's home last night.

638
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:16,781
It's possible that Howard
Ennis tried to break in.

639
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:19,117
If he did, he may
have left some clue

640
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,119
as to his whereabouts.

641
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:24,723
I'm in a hurry. Shall I select
your undergarments as well?

642
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,794
False alarm.

643
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:31,513
Ennis wasn't
here last night.

644
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:33,348
Well, someone was.

645
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,351
Couple of Miss Ennis's neighbors
threw these from the street.

646
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:38,687
I guess they didn't know about
her connection to her brother

647
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,772
until all the news coverage
this week.

648
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:42,974
Excuse me.

649
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:46,528
Yes, Chief.

650
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,931
Shall I take a picture
for Kathryn,

651
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,532
show her how her
little tome

652
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:53,001
affects the Ennis family
to this very day?

653
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:58,957
Hungry, Watson?

654
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,959
No, it's just this food.

655
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:02,994
It's exactly the opposite
of what someone

656
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,664
with kidney problems
should be eating.

657
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,950
The chips and the jerky
are high in sodium.

658
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:09,768
The licorice contains
glycyrrhizin,

659
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,003
which can interfere
with renal function.

660
00:30:12,005 --> 00:30:14,690
She would've known
not to buy these.

661
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:33,742
What is it?

662
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:36,745
It's frankincense.

663
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:38,830
With a hint of carrot seed.

664
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:46,922
Yeah.

665
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:49,758
Essential oils,
concentrated liquids

666
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,678
that contain volatile aroma
compounds from plants.

667
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,313
I know what
essential oils are.

668
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:57,215
Typically, they're used
in aromatherapy.

669
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:58,883
But you can smell them
on the bottom

670
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:01,052
of her drinking glass?
Mmm.

671
00:31:01,054 --> 00:31:02,887
Obviously you know
that liquids of this type

672
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:05,056
are highly toxic when ingested.

673
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:07,559
Especially
to the renal system.

674
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:13,665
Those things I said
about your parents...

675
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:18,870
I believed them when I put them
in your brother's profile.

676
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:22,174
But when I was
writing the book,

677
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:25,877
I couldn't prove the abuse.

678
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:29,514
I didn't want to back down,
so I made up a source.

679
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:32,517
After your family sued,

680
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,919
I paid one of your neighbors

681
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:37,356
to say he was the person
I talked to.

682
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:46,365
I'm sorry.

683
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,100
I'm sorry for
your father.

684
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:51,370
Your mother.

685
00:31:51,372 --> 00:31:53,372
You.

686
00:31:53,374 --> 00:31:55,106
I even owe

687
00:31:55,108 --> 00:31:57,292
your brother an apology.

688
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:01,913
Come a little closer.

689
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:04,750
It's getting hard
for me to talk.

690
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:07,452
Sure.

691
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,963
Hey.

692
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:20,599
Captain said
you accompanied Agent Drummond

693
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,601
to speak with Miss Ennis.
Are you with them now?

694
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:24,236
Well, I'm in the hall.

695
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:26,071
Miss Ennis said
she wanted some water.

696
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:27,606
She destroyed her kidneys
deliberately.

697
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:29,775
She's working with her brother.

698
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,416
You can arrest me now.

699
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,668
It's done.

700
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:49,603
She came here
to apologize.

701
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:55,181
As though a simple "I'm sorry"
could make up for any of it.

702
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,665
You're referring
to the allegations she made

703
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,983
about your parents in her book.

704
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,319
I hate that word.

705
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:01,854
"Allegations."

706
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,172
Call them what they are.

707
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,656
Lies.

708
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,910
Finding out
what Howard did

709
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:11,931
devastated us.

710
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:15,885
But Kathryn Drummond's book
is what destroyed us.

711
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:17,853
All of your correspondence

712
00:33:17,855 --> 00:33:20,689
over the last year
with your brother was monitored.

713
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:24,176
I imagine he procured
a cell phone from somewhere.

714
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:27,897
Yeah, he called me a little...
a little over a year ago

715
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,783
on the anniversary
of our dad's death.

716
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:33,202
He was crying.

717
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:36,906
He knew
that I was having a hard time.

718
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:39,241
Is that when he told you
to poison yourself?

719
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:42,127
I don't know
when he came up with the plan.

720
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:44,964
I... I-I just know that

721
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:48,300
it-it just sounded... right,

722
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:50,636
like it was...
it was supposed to happen.

723
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:54,890
He would be out there,
humiliating her,

724
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:58,310
and... I would be in here,

725
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:00,980
waiting for her.

726
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:02,598
I spoke to the surgeon
who was operating on her.

727
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,050
He thinks there's a chance
she'll survive.

728
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,402
And as for you--

729
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:07,820
you're going to jail.

730
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:09,772
Your kidneys are ruined,
and I'd say

731
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:12,724
you dropped a notch or two
on the old transplant list.

732
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:14,893
If I die, I die.

733
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:18,113
At least I know I died trying
to right a terrible wrong.

734
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:19,297
<i>He targeted her</i>

735
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:20,473
'cause he knew
that she was weak.

736
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,447
He knows that he could
bend her to his will.

737
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:23,639
Captain?

738
00:34:24,717 --> 00:34:27,268
Ennis again.

739
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,805
They just transferred
him from the office.

740
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,008
This is Captain Gregson.

741
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:37,410
If your men are scrambling
to trace this call,

742
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:39,071
you can tell them to relax.

743
00:34:39,073 --> 00:34:40,506
I'm calling through a router

744
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:42,241
that I placed across town
the other day.

745
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,909
'Course you are.

746
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,845
I heard on the news
that Kathryn's still alive.

747
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:50,516
I wanted you to know
that I think that's a shame.

748
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:54,153
Means I'm going to have
to keep making my point.

749
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,724
Sit tight.

750
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:07,483
What's up?

751
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,818
...S-O-P, Columbia University...

752
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:13,372
Signal for that station's
weak here.

753
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:15,124
So?

754
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:16,876
I need to look into something.

755
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:19,411
I'll call you shortly.

756
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,247
Mr. Ennis, do come in.

757
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:59,118
You could run,
but I-I do have your handgun.

758
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:09,712
It's just me. Please.

759
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:19,054
How'd you find me?

760
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:20,839
You were tuning your radio...

761
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:23,025
...when you called 
Captain Gregson.

762
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:27,279
You dialed past a number of
frequencies, but two stood out.

763
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:29,198
Columbia University's station

764
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,700
has quite a weak signal
strength-- just a few miles--

765
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:35,371
but it dwarfs the Greek-language
station that you skipped past.

766
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:37,289
That's a micro-broadcaster,

767
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:41,043
a tiny little station for
the Greek immigrant community.

768
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:45,047
Now, very little overlap
between those two stations.

769
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:47,967
Just a few blocks, actually.

770
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:50,753
There are a number of empty
buildings within those blocks,

771
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:53,088
but most of those are homes
that are being remodeled.

772
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,959
This one was seized under
federal asset forfeiture laws,

773
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:59,812
and, um... ta-da!

774
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:03,048
So, what do you want?

775
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,603
You and I have both been
profiled by Kathryn Drummond.

776
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:11,890
You've read "The Deductionist."

777
00:37:11,892 --> 00:37:14,276
You'll recall

778
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:18,113
she doesn't predict
a very pleasant end for me.

779
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:19,999
No, no, she doesn't.

780
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:22,567
She said that you were, um...

781
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:24,920
destined for self-destruction.

782
00:37:24,922 --> 00:37:27,840
Mmm. The term she used
was self-annihilation.

783
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:32,094
"A tangle of incandescent talent
and ingrained character flaws

784
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:33,846
"that can only lead to one end:

785
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:36,048
self-annihilation."

786
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:39,852
I think Drummond's good.

787
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:42,271
Mmm.

788
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:44,940
She predicted my struggles
with addiction.

789
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:47,860
And in my less hopeful moments,

790
00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:51,864
I wonder whether she might
be right about my ultimate fate.

791
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:54,933
She really has a way of getting
in your head, doesn't she?

792
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:57,152
Do you want to talk
about what she wrote?

793
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:59,154
No.

794
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:01,357
I'm not interested
in your words, Howard.

795
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,975
I'm interested in your actions.

796
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:04,793
I want to see

797
00:38:04,795 --> 00:38:08,497
if either of us could be more
than our profile.

798
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:11,783
Her assessment of you is...
equally withering.

799
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:15,337
She believes that you are,
at your core,

800
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:17,556
a coward.

801
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:20,225
That regardless of the violence
of your assaults,

802
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:23,178
you would shrink away
from any confrontation

803
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,480
on equal terms.

804
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:27,850
So you come here alone

805
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:30,302
and lay out a gun
and a pair of handcuffs.

806
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:31,737
Precisely.

807
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,322
An experiment.

808
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:35,140
Two choices.

809
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:38,410
Now, if you are, in fact,
a chicken-heart,

810
00:38:38,412 --> 00:38:40,079
you will choose the handcuffs

811
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:42,314
and surrender,

812
00:38:42,316 --> 00:38:44,917
but if you're willing to face
an opponent face-to-face,

813
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:46,418
you'll choose the gun.

814
00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:49,705
Personally,

815
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,423
I hope you go for the gun.

816
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:53,092
If you do,

817
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:54,760
it'll prove that Drummond
was wrong about you,

818
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:56,845
and if she was wrong
about you being a coward...

819
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:59,164
Then maybe she's wrong
about how you'll end up, too.

820
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,166
Maybe you won't die

821
00:39:01,168 --> 00:39:03,385
after turning back to drugs
to dull those senses

822
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:05,304
that just won't quite shut down.

823
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:09,058
Is that what
you're terrified of?

824
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,694
That and clowns.

825
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:14,446
Word of warning.

826
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:17,066
If you reach for the gun,

827
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,485
I will reach for you.

828
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:24,523
The choice is yours.

829
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,638
Well done.

830
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,207
Technically only supposed
to strike you in the pate.

831
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:44,810
But I suppose rules
were made to be broken.

832
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,942
Well, before you punch me
or suspend me,

833
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:01,827
please keep in mind
that I texted you

834
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:03,579
the moment I heard Ennis
enter the building.

835
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:06,915
And the reason you decided
to engage him on your own?

836
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,568
I-I needed to learn something.

837
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,370
And did you?

838
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:15,674
I can't say, really.

839
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:17,960
I won't know for years.

840
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:28,804
Damn it!

841
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,789
Hey, Joan.

842
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:33,442
Radiator's acting up again?

843
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:36,695
Never know when Old
Faithful's gonna blow.

844
00:40:36,697 --> 00:40:39,764
Listen, I appreciate
your calling ahead,

845
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:42,100
but we don't need to be
so formal about this.

846
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:43,702
It's a funny thing
about that radiator.

847
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:46,271
In the movie
that Cooper shot, uh,

848
00:40:46,273 --> 00:40:48,123
<i>he did several takes.</i>
<i>In some of the takes,</i>

849
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,324
<i>there's tape wrapped</i>
<i>around the air valve.</i>

850
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:50,826
<i>In others, there isn't.</i>

851
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,444
It's a basic
continuity error.

852
00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:53,962
I mean, I don't think

853
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:56,048
Cooper's directing career
is going to go anywhere.

854
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,616
Okay.

855
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:59,951
But it's almost as if
it started whistling,

856
00:40:59,953 --> 00:41:02,137
and then they called
someone in to fix it.

857
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:04,956
Someone with
a special shortcut

858
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,392
involving electrical tape.

859
00:41:07,394 --> 00:41:09,461
You were here the whole time,

860
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:11,796
weren't you, Bruce?

861
00:41:11,798 --> 00:41:14,016
But at-at first,
I-I could not figure out

862
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,518
why you would do
something like that.

863
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,904
And then I remembered that
this place is rent-controlled,

864
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:22,242
so if I violate my lease,
you can evict me,

865
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:24,429
and then you can charge
market-value for this place.

866
00:41:24,454 --> 00:41:28,360
I'm hardly the only guy,
with electrical tape.

867
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:31,651
No, but you know the actors
in that movie they work a lot

868
00:41:31,676 --> 00:41:33,380
and there not hard to track down.

869
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:35,944
They all confirmed that you
were here the whole time.

870
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:39,884
You participated in the filming
of an unlicensed production.

871
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,852
That is against the law.

872
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,098
What do you want?

873
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:47,394
I want you and Cooper
to pay for all of my stuff

874
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:49,406
to be put in storage until
I find a new place.

875
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:52,371
I also want 1200 dollars
for that couch.

876
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:54,637
Because after everything
it's been through in that movie,

877
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,704
it needs to be
taken out back and shot.

878
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:05,128
How's Kathryn?

879
00:42:05,153 --> 00:42:08,757
Unconscious, yet still
somehow annoying to me.

880
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:11,227
The doctor says she should
be out and about

881
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:13,408
practicing her pseudo
science in no time.

882
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,491
Oh, uh, I got you something.

883
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:22,445
To replace the one
desecrated by a sex act.

884
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,497
Thanks.

885
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,494
It gets better.

886
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:31,629
I don't understand. Nobody did
anything to my toothbrush

887
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:32,882
in that movie.

888
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:34,639
Not in the movie no,
certainly not.

889
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,278
I'm confused, are you saying that
you did something to my toothbrush?

890
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,590
Sherlock?
