1
00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:05,807
(birds singing,
dog barking in distance)

2
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:15,533
Hey, Adam, remember me?

3
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,685
- Going to school, huh?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:19,621
Come on, I'll
give you a ride.

5
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,140
It's okay. It's on my way.

6
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:25,627
What are those for?

7
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,029
They're for your parents.

8
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:30,165
Get in, I'll explain.

9
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:45,580
You're not dressed.

10
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,732
You said you'd go

11
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:49,067
jogging with me
this morning.

12
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,585
Doesn't sound like me.

13
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:52,487
Have you been up all night?

14
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,889
I started digging through one
of the files I keep

15
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,058
on open serial murders
after you'd gone to bed,

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,526
and I lost track of time.

17
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,995
Still losing track of it,
as a matter of fact,

18
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:03,231
so, no jogging. Sorry.

19
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,700
I thought we both agreed
that a little exercise would

20
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,069
be a good addition
to your sobriety regimen.

21
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,571
For future reference, when I say
that I agree with you,

22
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:11,906
it means I'm not listening.

23
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,743
You know what else is great?
Jazzercise.

24
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:16,094
I'll get you some
leg warmers, a headband.

25
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:17,479
You'll look awesome.

26
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:18,680
I agree with you.

27
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:20,014
The Balloon Man?

28
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:21,683
Is that who you've
been researching?

29
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,017
Yeah. Came to my attention

30
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,752
while I was still
living in London.

31
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:26,221
New York's
very own bogeyman.

32
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:28,356
- Obviously, you've heard of him.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:29,724
He took his first victim

34
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:31,943
from Cobble Hill
about seven years ago.

35
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:34,529
I was living just
a few blocks away. Adam.

36
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,314
Adam something.
I think he's taken

37
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,598
six kids since then?

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,435
- Seven as of last night.
- What?

39
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:42,787
I heard it on my police
scanner app around midnight.

40
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,155
Ten-year-old Mariana Castillo

41
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:46,324
snatched from her bedroom
in Astoria, Queens,

42
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:48,326
the abductor's signature
batch of balloons

43
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:50,078
left fluttering behind.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,414
I'd like to think that
Fleet Street would have devised

45
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,615
a more inventive sobriquet
than "The Balloon Man,"

46
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:56,968
but I do enjoy the inadvertent
E.E. Cummings reference.

47
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,586
Well, if you only heard it
on the scanner, then you haven't

48
00:01:58,588 --> 00:01:59,888
actually been assigned
to the case.

49
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,556
Yet.

50
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:03,425
Child abductions
and serial murders mean

51
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,510
psychiatric consultants
and joint task forces,

52
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:07,846
which in turn means
that Gregson can't call me in

53
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:09,230
until the police
commissioner approves.

54
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:11,299
And he doesn't get in
until 8:30 a.m.

55
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,967
Sharp. Add approximately
three minutes for coffee,

56
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,969
another six for a trip
to the loo.

57
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:17,305
Should be calling me in about,
hmm, 15 minutes.

58
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,824
(phone ringing)
Or sooner.

59
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:23,578
Holmes.

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,030
Crescent Street, Astoria.

61
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:27,749
I'll be there presently.

62
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,656
I could have sworn I was wearing
a shirt at some point.

63
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:36,040
GREGSON:
<i>The girl's bedroom</i>

64
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,792
is in the back.

65
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:40,161
Perp forced the lock on her
window around 9:30 last night,

66
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,880
took her, tied the
balloons to her bed.

67
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:44,665
Mom's a painter.
She went to a friend's gallery.

68
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,834
Dad went to the
bodega on the corner

69
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:49,387
to get some wine
around 9:45.

70
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,741
That's freshly broken.

71
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:57,228
By the girl, presumably,
grabbing for a handhold.

72
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,113
That's good.
She's a fighter.

73
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:01,199
If little girls could
actually win fights

74
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:02,534
against grown men, then, yeah,

75
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,702
it would be a cause
for great optimism.

76
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:12,043
(indistinct chatter)

77
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,543
What's this?

78
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:17,879
Parents are making a plea
to the twist that took their kid.

79
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:18,766
They mustn't.

80
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,150
Why not?

81
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:21,685
Excuse me. You can't do this.

82
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,103
We're live in ten, buddy,

83
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:23,737
so if you wouldn't mind.

84
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,121
You don't understand. It's...

85
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:28,424
We're on in ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,

86
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,376
five, four, three...
Look, I'm sorry.

87
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,880
Two, one.
Hey. Sherlock!

88
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,765
I'm sorry. I warned him!
MAN: What is this?

89
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,850
Who are you?
I'm just the man who's trying

90
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,602
to keep these people from
killing your daughter.

91
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:41,137
Mr. Holmes is a consultant with
the department, Mr. Castillo.

92
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,889
Daniel Peters, Kayla Jackson,
Billy Crawford.

93
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,358
Victims two, three and
five of the Balloon Man.

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,059
The only ones whose
bodies were found.

95
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,278
Forensics estimated
he kept Daniel alive

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,365
for a full day before burial,
Kayla for half a day,

97
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,099
Billy for almost two days.
Why the discrepancy?

98
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,952
Sherlock, they lost their
daughter. I think...

99
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,787
Last night, I discovered
a direct correlation

100
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,205
between the quickness

101
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:00,940
with which the killer
dispatched his victims

102
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,541
and the extent of their
parents' media exposure.

103
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,543
I could show you
the spreadsheet,

104
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,495
but in sum--
the more interviews,

105
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,531
the faster
the children died.

106
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,882
Is he right?

107
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:11,584
Usually.

108
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,002
I don't understand.

109
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,720
What does it matter
how many interviews we do?

110
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,089
The Balloon Man feeds off
the public grief

111
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,557
of his victims' families.

112
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,176
You nourish him,
he'll get bored, end the game.

113
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,510
Keep him hungry,

114
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,646
we might have two days.

115
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:25,648
You want to get
your little girl back?

116
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,851
It's simple.
You do everything I say.

Hmm?

That was the name

of the Balloon Man's
first victim.

124

Adam Kemper.
I just remembered.

125
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,494
The police found those
balloons on the sidewalk

126
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:25,130
where he'd taken Adam, the
ones that said, "Thank you"

127
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:27,499
Like Adam's parents had given

I read all the articles

I know it destroys

but being here in

Perhaps you'd like

I'm fine, thanks. I just...

No, it's not an expression

You're distracting me.

blame yourself
for what happened.

140
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,560
Actually, he can.

141
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,062
Excuse me?
Not for your daughter's

142
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:58,830
abduction, of course.

143
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:00,582
The kidnapper would have found
a way to take her eventually.

144
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:02,083
But you can and
should blame yourself

145
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:03,568
for impeding our
investigation.

146
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,719
I told you everything.

147
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,955
If everything includes
one very big lie.

148
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,840
Where's the wine that you
claimed you were buying

149
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,291
when your daughter
was taken last night?

150
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:12,310
In your hand.

151
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:14,045
And there's the lie.

152
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,431
Bodegas put the price tag
on the cap itself.

153
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,249
It saves stacking time.

154
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:21,086
Tag-- bottom.
You-- liar.

155
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,972
Obviously, you bought this
at another time,

156
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:25,423
presumably from the liquor store

157
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:26,924
on Atlantic where
you purchased

158
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,093
the case of Prosecco
you have in your pantry.

159
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,595
The bottle was
already in your fridge,

160
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:32,096
so it provided
an effective cover

161
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:34,065
as to why you were really
out of the house.

162
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,118
Tell us her name, Mr. Castillo,
right now.

163
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,436
Whose name?

164
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:40,238
His mistress.

165
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,823
(laughs)
There's no point

166
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,291
in trying to deny it.

167
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:44,609
Your lemon press gave you away.

168
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:47,045
Well, presses, to be precise.
One old.

169
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,464
<i>One quite new,</i>
<i>less than a year. The pattern</i>

170
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,216
repeats itself with
your two corkscrews,

171
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:52,967
<i>the pepper mills.</i>
<i>The older items</i>

172
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:54,369
belong to you and your wife.

173
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,221
The doubles were bought
by you when you moved

174
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:57,922
into your own place on Long Island.
How...?

175
00:06:57,924 --> 00:06:59,624
I found a letter in your
mail forwarded to you

176
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:02,393
from a long-term stay
hotel chain in Islip.

177
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:03,961
I assume that you
and your wife separated

178
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:05,814
for a while,
and then reconciled?

179
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,565
Which brings me
to your Caller ID.

180
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,300
You took a 15-second call

181
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,436
<i>from a Long Island area code</i>

182
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:13,988
<i>last night right before</i>
<i>you stepped out of the house.</i>

183
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,990
Presumably, from the woman who
precipitated your separation.

184
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,992
She rang, you walked
out of the house.

185
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:20,478
Why else would you hide
information from the police

186
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,248
when you're clearly desperate
to get your daughter back?

187
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:30,121
When Sara and I were separated,
I dated a co-worker.

188
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:33,541
She called me last night, said
she was in the neighborhood

189
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:35,493
and needed to see
me, but I swear,

190
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:37,545
I only went out to
tell her the she had

191
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:39,731
to stay away for good.
How could you not say anything?

192
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,349
Where did you meet her?

193
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:44,669
On the street, a few houses
down from here, but I swear,

194
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,272
I didn't go into her car.
I just talked to her

195
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,140
through her window.
I'd like to speak with her.

196
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:51,509
She had nothing to do with this.
Probably not, but can you think

197
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:53,695
of anyone else who was parked
on your block last night?

198
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:55,179
'Cause if she was
waiting for you,

199
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:56,814
I assume she was
facing your house.

200
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:57,899
If she was facing
your house...

201
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,400
Maybe she saw
something that

202
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:01,903
could help us find the guy
who took your daughter.

203
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:05,123
I'm sorry. (sniffles)

204
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,709
I just... I can't believe
I'm the reason

205
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,528
that lunatic got his hands
on Roberto's daughter.

206
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,864
If I hadn't called him, then...

207
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,968
GREGSON: Now, Ms.-Ms. Thomas,
it's all right.

208
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,587
Did you see or hear anything
out of the ordinary?

209
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:20,972
I never got out of my car.

210
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:22,407
So, what now?

211
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,275
THOMAS: I was just looking
at Roberto...

212
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,894
Do we go back to the Castillo
house, talk to the parents more?

213
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,712
You're doing it again--
talking.

214
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:29,497
What? I'm not
supposed to talk?

215
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:30,865
Situations like these,

216
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,600
cases that require
my total concentration--

217
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:34,552
I talk to you,
never the other way around.

218
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,020
What in the hell...?
Shh, shh.

219
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:38,856
THOMAS: ...and I headed
for the corner,

220
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:43,611
and then, um, some other car ran
the stop sign, almost hit me.

221
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,647
This was approximately when?
Never mind.

222
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,081
I already know. 9:40.

223
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,499
The vine that the girl managed

224
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,285
to pull free from the side
of the house-- it means

225
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:51,920
she was awake and struggling
when Balloon Man took her.

226
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,404
So?

227
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:55,340
So, examinations of
the three victims whose bodies

228
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:57,292
were recovered indicated
that he chloroformed them.

229
00:08:57,294 --> 00:09:00,628
He got sloppy with Mariana
Castillo, rushed things.

230
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,214
Why? Because of the sirens.

231
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,649
What sirens?

232
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,267
Listening to my scanner
last night,

233
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,436
I heard a report that preceded
Roberto Castillo's call

234
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:10,271
to 911 by mere minutes.

235
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:13,591
Some sort of domestic dispute.
A squad car was dispatched

236
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:16,561
to an address less than two
blocks from the Castillo home,

237
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:18,429
sirens blaring.

238
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:20,931
You think the perp panicked, and
thought the sirens were for him.

239
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,734
So he grabbed
the girl and ran.

240
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:25,370
Stashed her in his car, and
then tore through the stop sign.

241
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,904
Right in front
of Ms. Thomas here.

242
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:28,957
BELL:
The car that almost hit you--

243
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,291
do you remember
what it looked like?

244
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:33,328
Um, actually,
it was a van.

245
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,830
It's a kidnapper's vehicle of
choice. What else? Make? Model?

246
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:37,715
It happened so fast.

247
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:40,918
Uh, I'm not really a car person.

248
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,504
Are you a color person? I'll get
you started. Red? Blue? Black?

249
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:46,491
Brown. Dark brown.

250
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,160
So, what are we
looking for?

251
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,145
Home security camera?

252
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,815
Neighbor
with a photographic memory?

253
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:59,687
Hey, care to explain what
you said back at the station

254
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,942
about, you know, you talking
to me, not the other way around?

255
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:07,178
Yes, well aware
I'm doing it again.

256
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,579
I've found, over the years,

257
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:10,365
that nothing clears up
a difficult case

258
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,583
so much as stating it
to another person.

259
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,485
I talk, they listen,
and in talking,

260
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,921
I make connections
I may have otherwise missed.

261
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:19,090
One-way street, not two.

262
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,175
Who did you speak
to back in London?

263
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:24,178
Oh, lots of people.
Waitstaff, cabdrivers.

264
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,180
The occasional prostitute.

265
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,716
Better listeners
than you might think.

266
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:31,019
Right. You don't look good.

267
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,137
My appearance has always meant
so much to me.

268
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:34,972
You haven't eaten today, have you?
(sighs)

269
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:36,841
No sleep,
no food...

270
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,359
Will make Sherlock
a dull boy.

271
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,695
People in recovery
have a tendency to relapse

272
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,196
when they
haven't eaten...

273
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,614
You know what, Watson?

274
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,949
I take it all back.

275
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:46,534
I'm beginning
to find the chatter

276
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:47,902
that accompanies
your companionship

277
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,287
extremely useful.

278
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:51,021
A bit like white noise.

279
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:54,459
It puts me in a state where
I think, and I observe better.

280
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,010
For example...

281
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:59,530
What? If this is your idea
of a brown van,

282
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,466
then you're even more
sleep-deprived than I thought.

283
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:03,534
Note the parking tickets. Hmm?

284
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,636
It's been here for days.
Yet there are small

285
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,921
skid marks beneath each tire,

286
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:08,923
indicating it's been moved
several inches.

287
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:12,560
Someone sideswiped it.

288
00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:14,545
My money is
on a speeding van

289
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:16,564
driven
by a panicked kidnapper.

290
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:19,484
Well, the paint from the
other car is supposed to be...

291
00:11:19,486 --> 00:11:22,019
It's dark brown as per
Ms. Thomas' description.

292
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,554
But there's blue
and white paint

293
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,740
mixed in with the brown.
Means it's brown now,

294
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:28,058
but was originally painted
white and blue--

295
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,828
a very distinctive white
and blue as a matter of fact.

296
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,830
Detective Bell.

297
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:35,183
Excuse me.

298
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:38,336
We are looking for a
decommissioned NYPD van,

299
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:40,538
presumably sold at auction,
then painted brown.

300
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,173
It has a long scrape
down one side

301
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,591
where it struck
this sedan.

302
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:45,009
Issue the BOLO now,

303
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:48,096
we may find the Balloon
Man before lunch.

304
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:57,922
I'm not sleeping.

305
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,108
I'm just reviewing the details
of the case in my mind.

306
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,258
I'm sorry, were
you talking to me?

307
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,610
'Cause I thought I was

308
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,812
just a cavernous expanse
between two ears.

309
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,265
You mustn't be
so sensitive, Watson.

310
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:12,537
The service you're providing
is quite valuable.

311
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:19,276
For a brief stretch
in London,

312
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,797
I talked only to a phrenology
bust I kept in my study.

313
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,799
I named him Angus.

314
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,334
Wasn't the same.

315
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:29,286
I realized that when
it came to listeners,

316
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:33,141
I preferred animate
to inanimate.

317
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,475
Was quite
a breakthrough, really.

318
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:37,261
Angus.

319
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:40,681
I'm glad I made it to
the animate category.

320
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:44,969
Just got a hit
on our BOLO.

321
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:47,071
Car Five, you
still got the eye?

322
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,073
CAR FIVE: Yeah, driver's a male white
wearing a hoodie.

323
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:50,858
All I can make out.

324
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,743
Aviation One, you getting anything
on the thermal imaging?

325
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:54,412
AVIATION ONE: Negative.
We're too high to see if...

326
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:57,165
CAR FIVE: He made us.
Heading north on 78th.

327
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,002
(sirens wailing)

328
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,246
Police!
Hands up!

329
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:15,616
(grunts)

330
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:21,856
She's not here.

331
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,275
(indistinct radio transmission)

332
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:27,628
(panting)

333
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,648
Cap, that's not our guy.

334
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,033
He would have been
in sixth grade

335
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:34,302
when Balloon Man took
his first victim.

336
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,874
GREGSON:
Hey, what are you doing?

337
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:43,878
Holmes.
Sorry,

338
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,029
it's just that,
well, according

339
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:46,247
to that birthmark on his neck,

340
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:47,965
you're quite right.

341
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,468
This is not the man that took
Adam Kemper back in 2005.

342
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,337
This <i>is</i> Adam Kemper.

343
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,929
BELL:
Adam.

344
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,777
Adam, please
talk to me.

345
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:12,880
Now, we know who you are, Adam,

346
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:16,634
your fingerprints confirmed it,
so come on,

347
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,586
tell me how you ended up
in that van.

348
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:20,271
We've got
a psychiatrist coming,

349
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,858
but I don't think it's going
to make much difference.

350
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,093
This kid just doesn't
want to engage.

351
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,311
WATSON:
Well, have you notified

352
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,147
his parents?
Commissioner

353
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:30,148
made the call.

354
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,149
They're on their way.

355
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:32,433
Should only take 'em
an hour

356
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:34,002
to fight through
all the media outside.

357
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:35,936
Story of the century, this.

358
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:40,742
Missing boy presumed dead,
recovered after all these years.

359
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,910
WATSON: Well, the fact that he was
found in a van that we thought

360
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:44,579
belonged to the
Balloon Man--

361
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,831
that's obviously more
than a coincidence, right?

362
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,801
I read about a
case like this.

363
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,170
Police in Dubuque
found a 15-year-old

364
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:53,921
who'd been missing
for seven years.

365
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:55,339
Now, the man who
had taken him

366
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:56,808
had enrolled
him in school.

367
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,959
He even let him have
friends over to the house.

368
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:00,762
The boy never tried to
leave because he had grown

369
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:02,180
to sympathize
with his captor.

370
00:15:02,182 --> 00:15:03,898
If that's what's
happened here,

371
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,983
it would explain why Adam
was running from the police

372
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,635
instead of to them.

373
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,270
Because he's actually grown
to care for the lunatic.

374
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:10,655
If Adam's
still alive,

375
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:13,474
maybe some of the
other victims are, too.

376
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:16,477
Adam was special-- his first.

377
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,546
The Balloon Man's second
and third victims are

378
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,314
two of only three
to be recovered.

379
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:23,251
Their condition suggests that
he rather liked the killing.

380
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:28,489
After he had a taste, I don't
believe he ever looked back.

381
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:31,509
Question now is,
what role did Adam play

382
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:32,660
in their deaths?

383
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:34,345
WATSON:
You think Adam helped him?

384
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:38,666
Well, you said it yourself:
he sympathized with his captor.

385
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:41,436
Question is, to what degree?

386
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:44,889
We did find him
in that van.

387
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:47,058
CSU is processing it
for evidence

388
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,777
to try and prove whether
Mariana Castillo was inside.

389
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,196
In the meantime, we've got
Adam on auto theft,

390
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,150
but if he doesn't start
talking to us soon,

391
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:57,902
we're going to run
out of time to find

392
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:00,121
the Castillo girl.

393
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:07,829
I want to talk to him.

394
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:09,464
I think I can get
through to him.

395
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:12,733
Holmes, this is a
delicate situation.

396
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:14,969
And I can, on occasion, be
indelicate, I'm well aware,

397
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:16,387
but if you think
I'd do anything

398
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,089
to jeopardize the
life of that girl...

399
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:19,423
Intentionally,
of course not.

400
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,425
We're talking
about a kid here--

401
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:25,012
a kid that's been traumatized,
maybe even brainwashed.

402
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,548
A kid who wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for me.

403
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,234
What, oh, you think that gives
you the right to question him?

404
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:32,937
You're a consultant,
not a cop.

405
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:34,221
And given
the very real possibility

406
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:35,523
that the young man
is accessory

407
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,159
to several horrific crimes,
maybe "not a cop"

408
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,994
is exactly what he needs
at the moment, hmm?

409
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:42,947
(elevator bell dings) Ten minutes--
that's all I ask.

410
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,335
You've got five.

411
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,213
(sighing)

412
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,052
Hello, Adam.

413
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:08,606
My name is Sherlock.

414
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,424
You can probably tell
from my accent,

415
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,977
I'm not a New York City
police officer,

416
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:15,530
nor am I
a psychiatrist,

417
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:18,032
which makes me the only person
you're going to talk to today

418
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:20,568
who isn't going
to lie to you.

419
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,605
The people
who were here earlier--

420
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:27,608
Detective Bell
and the others--

421
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,962
they told you that the man
who took you seven years ago

422
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:35,800
was a bad man,
that he hurt you, abused you.

423
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:38,719
But they don't know
the whole story, do they?

424
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,721
He also took care of you,

425
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:43,975
kept a roof over your head,

426
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:46,177
taught you to drive.

427
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,179
Loved you.

428
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,848
My father
packed me off

429
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,317
to boarding school when I was
just eight years old.

430
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,986
(chuckles)

431
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,637
I was a little bit
of a know-it-all--

432
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,740
well, I was
a massive know-it-all, actually.

433
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,525
Turned a lot of the other boys

434
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,310
at the school against me, hmm,

435
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:05,930
especially one
by the name of Anders Larson.

436
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:09,283
Now, over the course
of the next year,

437
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,785
Anders took his anger

438
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:15,539
out on me in, uh,
myriad cruel and terrible ways--

439
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,210
nothing close to what
you experienced, of course, but

440
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:21,512
it seemed worth mentioning.

441
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:26,300
You see...
the more Anders hurt me...

442
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,337
...the more I felt gratitude

443
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,607
that he was actually
paying attention to me.

444
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,525
That in, in tormenting me,
he was attempting

445
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:38,713
to correct what I knew
to be wrong with myself.

446
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,615
One day,

447
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:45,820
after a particularly brutal
lesson...

448
00:18:46,905 --> 00:18:48,856
...left me in a very bad way,

449
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:52,426
a teacher asked me
who was responsible.

450
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:54,578
I said I'd fallen
down the stairs.

451
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,363
Funny, the things
that we do

452
00:18:56,365 --> 00:18:58,416
for the people
that we care about.

453
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:02,837
Uh, did he do that to you--

454
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,456
the person that you care about?

455
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,092
No.

456
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:09,727
I was in my room

457
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,547
the other night...
and it was hot.

458
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,616
I tried to open the window,
but it was stuck,

459
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:17,785
and my hand went
through the pane.

460
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:20,071
(whispers
indistinctly)

461
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:22,256
And he took care of me.

462
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,243
He put a bandage on it.

463
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:27,445
Of course he did.

464
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,496
He loves you.

465
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,498
He does everything for me.

466
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,732
He comes home

467
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:33,417
every morning
and brings me doughnuts.

468
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,286
He doesn't need to, but he does.

469
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,338
I never even asked...

470
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,789
No more questions.

471
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,240
He lawyered up.

472
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:41,292
Via telepathy?

473
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:42,310
Via his parents.

474
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:44,929
They're here.

475
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,580
I'm sorry, I
know you have

476
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:48,415
questions for
Adam, but come on,

477
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,518
you think we don't know that
you think Adam may have had

478
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,635
something to do
with what happened

479
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:53,521
to the other
children?

480
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,473
It's a possibility, yes,

481
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,525
which is why we'd like
to keep talking to him--

482
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:00,561
to see if he can help us find
Mariana Castillo.

483
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:04,281
I can't imagine what they're
going through right now.

484
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,432
Hmm?

485
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:06,600
By the way, that was
really something

486
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:08,369
back there with Adam.

487
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:11,322
The story about your bully
was really very moving.

488
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:12,540
Any of it true?

489
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:15,409
I went
to boarding school.

490
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:17,411
ATTORNEY: You should know, Captain,
that we've already broached

491
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:19,246
the possibility
of an immunity deal

492
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:21,382
with the district attorney's
office.

493
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,050
Adam would be given immunity
for any crimes

494
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,218
he may have been compelled
to commit

495
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,120
by the individual who took him,

496
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:29,223
and in exchange he'd tell you
everything he knows about the man.

497
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:31,392
He'll also help you try and locate
the bodies of the victims

498
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:32,566
that were never recovered.

499
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:34,295
We expect to hear back
from the D.A. by morning.

500
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:36,731
By then it may be too late
for the Castillo girl.

501
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,465
ATTORNEY: Which is why we
very much hope

502
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,985
that you'll support
our proposal.

503
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,488
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

504
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,111
Yes?

505
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:51,195
Support the proposal,
don't support it.

506
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:52,747
It doesn't matter.

507
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,415
My conversation with Adam
may have been aborted,

508
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,167
but it was far
from a total waste.

509
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,002
What do you mean?
Adam said the Balloon Man

510
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,337
comes home every morning
with doughnuts.

511
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,589
That means he works nights.

512
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:04,158
It doesn't sound
like much, I know,

513
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,993
but it's more than we previously
knew about him.

514
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:07,545
And you think
you can run with that?

515
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:10,347
From a drop of water, a logician
can infer the possibility

516
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,715
of an Atlantic or a Niagara

517
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,768
without having seen
or heard of either one.

518
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,052
I've got my drop of water.

519
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,021
Now allow me to infer.

520
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:20,274
WATSON: He worked nights-- you
think that's really going

521
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:21,859
to be enough to identify
the Balloon Man?

522
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:23,561
Of course not,
but it's a start.

523
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:25,362
Our previous suspect pool
included

524
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:27,314
virtually every man in the city.

525
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:30,534
Now it's been reduced
to every man who works nights.

526
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,403
You're gonna stay up all
night again, aren't you?

527
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:34,038
You can't stop me,
Watson.

528
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,906
I don't care how I look,
I don't care how I smell,

529
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,075
I'm not going to sleep.

530
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,294
Well, I have no intention
of stopping you.

531
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,630
I mean, what you're doing
to your body isn't healthy,

532
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:44,832
you know, especially for
someone so fresh out of rehab,

533
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,133
but I get it.

534
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,751
I will happily loan you
my ears if it means

535
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:49,136
getting Mariana Castillo
back alive and well.

536
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:51,705
I appreciate that,
but at the moment

537
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:52,973
I do not require
a listener.

538
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:54,475
I will have nothing
to talk about

539
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:57,044
until I've reviewed
all of these files.

540
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:58,879
All right, then,
I'll take a box.

541
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,598
No, no, no, it doesn't
work like that.

542
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,899
My brain is the filter

543
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:03,601
all this needs to go
through, not yours.

544
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:06,053
I need to read every
word, study every image.

545
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:07,521
All right, then,
I'll help you stay awake.

546
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:08,739
All right, you know
where the coffee is.

547
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:10,390
It's not
about the coffee.

548
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:12,610
Whoa, then, what
are you proposing?

549
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:14,161
I'm gonna teach you
something--

550
00:22:14,163 --> 00:22:17,248
a little trick that I learned
back in medical school.

551
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,083
(sighs)

552
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:21,252
(exhaling)

553
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:25,256
This is what they taught
you in medical school?

554
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:28,509
When I was cramming for a test
and I was tired,

555
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:31,178
I would do a hundred of these,
get my blood pumping.

556
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,265
Kept me from falling asleep.

557
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:35,483
I was valedictorian.

558
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:38,385
I'm just saying.

559
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:01,625
Watson!

560
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:03,327
He changed jobs.

561
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:04,545
Who?

562
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:05,946
The Balloon Man.

563
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:07,781
A few years ago, the
FBI worked a theory

564
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:09,667
that he was an
exterminator.

565
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:11,952
Adam Kemper's family had
had their house fumigated

566
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,387
just the week before
he disappeared.

567
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:14,722
Yes, I'm still
holding, yes.

568
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,640
No one thought
much of it

569
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:20,227
until these were taken

570
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:23,964
right outside the homes
of victims two and three.

571
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,683
Oh, both neighbors
had their houses tented.

572
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:30,020
In 2008, the FBI interviewed
all 35 of the employees

573
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:32,306
of the company that
fumigated the Kempers' home,

574
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,108
but failed to elicit
any strong suspects.

575
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,076
They eventually discarded their
theory when no connection

576
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:38,312
to extermination was found
in or around the homes

577
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:39,914
of the subsequent victims.

578
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,032
See, the thing is, I think
they were onto something.

579
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,418
I think the Balloon Man
<i>was</i> an exterminator,

580
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,087
but then changed jobs between
victims three and four.

581
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:48,672
See this?

582
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:51,292
It's a copy of <i>The</i>
<i>Investor's Post.</i>

583
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:53,127
You can tell from
the distinctive

584
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,012
salmon-colored
paper stock.

585
00:23:55,014 --> 00:23:57,131
The parents of victim number
four had a subscription.

586
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,166
As do the parents
of Mariana Castillo,

587
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,500
the most recent victim.

588
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:02,269
I saw one in their
kitchen yesterday.

589
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:05,022
<i>The parents of victims</i>
<i>five, six and seven</i>

590
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:08,025
are not subscribers, but
have neighbors who are.

591
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:11,812
So the Balloon Man <i>was</i> an
exterminator; now he delivers

592
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:14,514
papers at night for
<i>The Investor's Post.</i>

593
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:16,734
Mm, he identified his first
three victims through

594
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:19,686
his first job, his last five
victims through his second.

595
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,338
I'm on the phone
with the paper now.

596
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,290
They're telling me the name
of the man responsible

597
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,524
for the Castillos' route.

598
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:26,327
They think I'm
a subscriber,

599
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,663
looking to send
a belated tip.

600
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:30,881
Yes, yes, hello.

601
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,553

Bring us back our daughter.

634
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:37,344
I'm afraid it's not that simple,
Mrs. Castillo.

635
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,181
The department can't trade
one victim for another.

636
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:43,016
Is that what you really
think Adam Kemper is?

637
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,202
I saw on the news
this morning,

638
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,071
the D.A. offered him
an immunity deal.

639
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,957
If he's just a victim, what
does he need immunity from?

640
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,692
Given the givens
in this case,

641
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,994
the D.A. felt
he had to offer that deal.

642
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:56,764
Now, I know the media
has broached the possibility

643
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:59,967
of Adam being involved somehow
in the Balloon Man's crimes,

644
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:02,052
but we haven't confirmed
any of that yet.

645
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,755
So how long do we wait for
you to confirm something?

646
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:07,091
Um, an hour, a day, a week?

647
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:10,427
I mean, he just said we only
have till noon tomorrow.

648
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,313
Mr. Castillo...
Has anybody asked Adam Kemper

649
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:13,330
what he wants?

650
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,316
He's 19-- an adult.

651
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,735
If he was really some sort of
partner to this monster,

652
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:21,221
then isn't it possible
that he wants to go back?

653
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,573
Victims of horrific abuse

654
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:25,058
are often protective
of their abusers.

655
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,561
It doesn't mean we should
send them back for seconds.

656
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,029
GREGSON:
No, listen,

657
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,831
the immunity deal
is on the table.

658
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,466
Then why hasn't
he taken it?

659
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:33,901
Because he's been
traumatized.

660
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,537
He's hardly speaking,
even to his own parents.

661
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,340
Come on.

662
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,382
If anything happens
to our daughter,

663
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:50,668
your head is the one we're going
to be calling for in the press.

664
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,727
(door closes)

665
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:01,061
So now what?

666
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:02,396
We go back to the files.

667
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:04,264
We see if there's
any clue that we missed

668
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,900
as to where Abbott is
keeping the girl.

669
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:07,434
That's one option.

670
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,736
You have another?

671
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:10,538
When Adam's parents
hired a lawyer,

672
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,073
they put a wall
between him and the NYPD.

673
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,108
No cop can talk to him.

674
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,827
No cop.

675
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,446
That's interesting.

676
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,282
And where is he now?

677
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,499
What?

678
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,951
I'm sore.

679
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,886
Only did about a thousand
squats last night.

680
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:30,090
Listen, I wanted to thank
you for all of your help.

681
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,809
Well, always happy
to listen.

682
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,143
No, no, no,
actually, Watson,

683
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,845
I was the one who
listened last night,

684
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,348
and I heard someone who
was willing to accommodate

685
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,733
the difficult process
of a difficult person

686
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:41,101
for the greater good.

687
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:44,104
It's a rare quality,
in my experience.

688
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:47,191
I may even listen to you
again in the future.

689
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:49,977
Not your sobriety
twaddle, of course.

690
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,946
Just your thoughts
on cases.

691
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:04,925
Thank you
for seeing me, Adam.

692
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:06,827
You're the only
one who gets it.

693
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,879
(chuckles softly)

694
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:11,348
Well, you know by now we've
identified him, don't you?

695
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,267
Samuel Abbott?

696
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:14,635
Are you worried about him?

697
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,336
He's my dad.

698
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,923
Is that why you've been hesitant
to sign the immunity deal?

699
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,675
Would you turn in your dad?

700
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,777
I'd trade my dad for a Tic Tac,

701
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,181
but that's my dad, not yours.

702
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,818
The sooner we find him,
the better off he'll be.

703
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,988
He hasn't hurt
Mariana Castillo yet.

704
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,574
You loved him...

705
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:40,494
but you didn't love
what he did.

706
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:42,296
I can tell.

707
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:48,368
He did make you help
with the others, didn't he?

708
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,422
He's my dad.

709
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:54,141
That doesn't mean
it wasn't hard.

710
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,346
Is that why you didn't want
to sign the deal?

711
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:02,215
Because you don't feel
you deserve it?

712
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,408
I never...

713
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:16,063
I never knew why it was
so important to him.

714
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,731
But I loved him.

715
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,501
And when he asked me to take--
help take the others,

716
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,202
then I told him I'd do that.

717
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:23,487
It's okay.

718
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,738
No, it isn't.

719
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,507
Nothing's okay.
I'm so confused.

720
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:28,408
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

721
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,927
(sniffling)

722
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,383
You told me the other day
that you'd never lie to me.

723
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:39,503
That's right.

724
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,805
So tell me.

725
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,191
If I sign that deal,

726
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:46,360
and if I tell you
where you can find him,

727
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:49,580
do you think it'll make up
for the things I've done?

728
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,617
No, I don't.

729
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,222
Six other children are dead,
thanks to your dad.

730
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:03,477
To whatever degree
you assisted him,

731
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:06,113
you will never get their blood
off your hands.

732
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,973
But that doesn't mean
you shouldn't try.

733
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:24,014
Okay.

734
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:27,467
I'll sign the papers.

735
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,153
I'll tell you where we live.

736
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,988
That's where
you'll find the girl.

737
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,647
(loud banging)

738
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,784
(gasps)

739
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,755
Drop the gun and let her go.

740
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,494
Now!

741
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,634
Tell Adam I'm sorry.

742
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:02,286
(gunshot)

743
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,305
(indistinct radio transmissions,
camera shutter clicking)

744
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,276
Mariana's okay.

745
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:10,611
She's terrified.

746
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:12,646
She hasn't been hurt.

747
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:15,482
You can go home, get some rest.

748
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,485
You okay?

749
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,404
He wasn't what I was expecting.

750
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,739
Who?
Samuel Abbott.

751
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,541
He dominated Adam.

752
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,526
I was expecting
a more virile man.

753
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,378
Just seems a bit...

754
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,798
feeble.

755
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,101
And that back brace.

756
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:35,869
WATSON:
Three scars.

757
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,704
Means major surgery, multiple
operations, fused vertebrae.

758
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,556
Makes sense that
he would've needed Adam

759
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,757
to help him get around.

760
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,892
(wind whistling)
Do you hear that?

761
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:44,311
What?
What...?

762
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:51,902
WATSON:
My God.

763
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,987
This is where
Adam slept?

764
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,395
(wind whistling)

765
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,086
What's wrong?

766
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:28,355
That man out there, Abbott,
is not the Balloon Man.

767
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,364
HOLMES:
Hello, Adam.

768
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,567
Mr. Holmes,
what are you doing here?

769
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:42,369
Thought it was time for
another one of our little chats.

770
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:44,705
How did you get into my room?
Through the window.

771
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:47,574
Somehow I managed to open it
without slicing my hand.

772
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:48,909
You said that...

773
00:33:48,911 --> 00:33:51,395
you cut your hand
trying to open a window

774
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,679
in your room.

775
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:55,949
<i>Your</i> room.
Not Samuel Abbott's.

776
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:59,786
So imagine my surprise
when I saw your room today.

777
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,890
Two lamps, proper bed,
television.

778
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:05,592
Virtual palace
compared to Samuel's room.

779
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:08,428
All he had was a stained
mattress and a tattered sheet.

780
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,731
No, you're talking
about <i>my</i> room.

781
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,966
That's where he made me sleep.
No,

782
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,768
don't lie to me, Adam,
not again.

783
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,437
You told me when we met
that you injured your hand

784
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:18,555
<i>trying to open a window</i>

785
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,473
in your room,
the master bedroom.

786
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,858
<i>That's where</i>
<i>the broken pane was.</i>

787
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,278
Samuel Abbott
was not the Balloon Man.

788
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,046
You were.

789
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:28,665
Mr. Holmes, I-I...
I examined the pillows

790
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,784
<i>in the larger room--</i>
<i>I found nothing</i>

791
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:33,120
<i>but short, dark hair--</i>
<i>your hair.</i>

792
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:34,922
On the pillows
in the smaller room,

793
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:36,506
I found nothing
but Samuel's hair--

794
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,958
stringy and gray.

795
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,326
You occupied the master bedroom

796
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,128
because you were the master.

797
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,004
(quiet sigh)

798
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,673
You tricked me, Adam.

799
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,843
That doesn't happen very often.

800
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,012
I thought you were a dullard.

801
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,198
You're actually...

802
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,183
quite brilliant.

803
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,018
It must take
a huge intellect

804
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,956
for a boy to turn the tables
on the man who abducted him.

805
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,358
You have no idea.
Whose idea

806
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,526
was it to take more children?

807
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,063
Was it his... or was it yours?

808
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:19,650
I'd just turned 14;
I was lonely.

809
00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:23,220
No. What you wanted was
to make someone else the victim,

810
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:24,655
hurt them...

811
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:25,922
like you'd been hurt.

812
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,874
No, you're forgetting
the parents.

813
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,877
They're the ones
that I got to see on TV,

814
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,613
crying, begging
the monster

815
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:35,616
who took their son or daughter
to give them back.

816
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:38,769
See, when Samuel took me,
it was very difficult at first.

817
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:40,687
I had to put up
with a lot.

818
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:42,739
But he did let me watch TV,

819
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,659
and so I got to see
my parents on the news

820
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:47,944
at least once a day, pleading

821
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,613
with Samuel
to let me go.

822
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:50,998
And the funny
thing was,

823
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,001
he wasn't
the least bit affected.

824
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:55,802
But I was.

825
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:57,237
You got off on it.

826
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,588
I really found myself.

827
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,174
And as for how I turned
the tables on him,

828
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:03,043
let's just say
it's not very difficult

829
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:05,178
when your captor has an IQ

830
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,747
south of 90.

831
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,715
Psychological abuse
followed by physical--

832
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:10,133
all very standard.

833
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,019
And the trade
he proposed yesterday--

834
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:15,055
Mariana for me--
wasn't even his idea.

835
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:16,973
It was a
contingency plan.

836
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,692
If I ever got caught,
he was supposed

837
00:36:18,694 --> 00:36:20,027
to use the hostage that we had,

838
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:21,928
or take a new one,
to secure my release.

839
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,182
And the idiot didn't even have
a clue that the police

840
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,801
would never go for that
in a million years.

841
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,820
But you knew it
would give them incentive

842
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:31,938
to offer you an immunity deal.

843
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,242
Must have taken
everything you had

844
00:36:35,244 --> 00:36:39,446
not to jump on that deal
the first time it came up.

845
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:42,716
Are you here to kill me,
Mr. Holmes?

846
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:45,001
Because I
have to admit

847
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:49,639
I find the possibility
very... exciting.

848
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,311
I'm gonna go brush my teeth now.

849
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:57,647
I don't think you're gonna
be here when I get back.

850
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,667
If it's any
consolation,

851
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:03,770
I don't think I'm gonna stay
in this city much longer.

852
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:06,406
I think it's time
to move someplace else,

853
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:08,942
meet new people.

854
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:12,312
I'm gonna miss our little chats.

855
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,409
WATSON: I just got an e-mail from my
friend from the D.A.'s office.

856
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,493
He said the language
from the immunity agreement

857
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:37,710
is pretty ironclad. "Adam Kemper
. is immune from prosecution."

858
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:39,916
"For any crimes committed
in consort with Samuel Abbott,

859
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,317
aka the Balloon Man."

860
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:42,902
Yes, I'm quite familiar
with the phrasing.

861
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:45,604
I've been reviewing it myself.

862
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:49,425
(sighs) Look, what that
kid did is... disgusting.

863
00:37:49,427 --> 00:37:51,560
I hate the fact that he's
out there in the world.

864
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,145
But you did make
a difference.

865
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,313
You saved Mariana,

866
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,714
and you told the police

867
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:57,883
what kind of person
Adam Kemper really is.

868
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:01,403
I handed a psychopath
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

869
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,574
You're not the only one
he fooled.

870
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:07,693
If you're trying to blow off
steam, squats would be cheaper.

871
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:09,328
Easier on the decor, too.
I can't.

872
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,229
I overdid last night
and pulled a muscle.

873
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:12,581
My back's been sore all day.

874
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,417
I said a hundred squats,
not a thousand.

875
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:21,406
Back pain.

876
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,877
Yeah.

877
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:29,081
Thank you.

878
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,517
Dear sweet...

879
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,168
back pain.

880
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,754
(birds chirping)

881
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:51,236
Morning, Adam.

882
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:55,107
(exhales)

883
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:57,042
You picturing

884
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,111
those two begging for
their son's life?

885
00:38:59,113 --> 00:39:02,280
No, it's nice out-- I'm
just passing the time.

886
00:39:02,282 --> 00:39:04,717
You look kind of tired.

887
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,336
I'm getting that
a lot lately.

888
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:10,139
Listen, before you leave town,
I wanted to ask you

889
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,157
about William Crawford.

890
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,676
Your fifth victim.

891
00:39:13,678 --> 00:39:16,128
Parents called him Billy.
Ah.

892
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,097
You abducted him on April 3,

893
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,065
2009.
Right, yeah.

894
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,684
Blond boy.
He cried a lot.

895
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:23,902
Well, yes, I'm sure you
could reminisce all day.

896
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,021
Still, not your
cleanest work.

897
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:29,525
The police found
his body on April 7.

898
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:31,860
Yeah, we buried him
deeper after that.

899
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,029
Actually, let me be
clear about that,

900
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:36,648
in case you have somebody listening
to our conversations.

901
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,201
Mr. Abbott made me bury
them deeper after that.

902
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:42,588
Whoever had the idea,
I think it was a good one,

903
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,459
because the police found skin
under William's fingernails.

904
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:50,662
Definitely came from
one of his attackers.

905
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:53,274
We ran it against Samuel
Abbott's DNA this morning.

906
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:55,026
And let me guess
it didn't match.

907
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:57,603
Is this supposed
to be scaring me?

908
00:39:57,605 --> 00:39:59,972
It's probably mine.

909
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:03,192
So what?
I have an immunity deal.

910
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:04,977
Yes, you do.
You cannot be prosecuted

911
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:08,513
for any crimes committed, quote,
"in consort with," unquote,

912
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:10,282
the Balloon Man.

913
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,517
Thing is...

914
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:15,154
Samuel Abbott broke
three vertebrae in his back

915
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:17,373
on March 23, 2009.

916
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,992
That's why he couldn't work
as an exterminator anymore.

917
00:40:19,994 --> 00:40:22,127
That's why he wore a back brace.

918
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,663
The surgery had him
in hospital for three weeks.

919
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:28,467
I believe he was
in traction the entire time.

920
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:32,638
Difficult to abduct
and murder a young boy

921
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,372
when you're feeling <i>well,</i>

922
00:40:34,374 --> 00:40:35,924
I'd imagine.

923
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:39,745
From a hospital bed,
I'd say it was impossible.

924
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,815
I have an immunity deal.

925
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:47,736
For crimes committed in consort
with Samuel Abbott.

926
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:52,390
But you took William Crawford
on your own, didn't you?

927
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,577
What happened?

928
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:59,397
You get bored while
your playmate was in hospital?

929
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,701
Actually, you know what,
don't tell me,

930
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:05,704
'cause... I don't care.

931
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:14,763
Are those for me?

932
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:18,033
I called them right after your
parents told me you were in the park.

933
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:20,586
You're welcome
to try and run.

934
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:23,522
I've recently started
developing my core, you know?

935
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:26,442
Could use a bit of a workout.

936
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:30,929
Oh, no. A fair fight's
not really your speed, is it?

937
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:37,035
It was only one murder.

938
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,221
And Samuel

939
00:41:39,223 --> 00:41:40,489
abused me.

940
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:42,691
I'll be out soon.

941
00:41:43,776 --> 00:41:45,944

What are you doing?

945
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:03,128
Depriving you
of all stimuli.

946
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,481
It's time for you to get some sleep.
What?

947
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:07,182
No. No, no, no, no. No.

948
00:42:07,184 --> 00:42:09,601
Right after you solve a case
you're flushed with success.

949
00:42:09,603 --> 00:42:11,103
We should double down on work.

950
00:42:11,105 --> 00:42:12,104
We?

951
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,405
You, me...

952
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,773
Angus.

953
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:17,559
Some combination of the three.

954
00:42:17,561 --> 00:42:20,112
You already know
I favor you. Mm?

955
00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:21,146
Hey!

956
00:42:21,148 --> 00:42:22,948
No! No! This is...

957
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,666
Right now I'm
full of energy,

958
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,084
ideas, momentum.

959
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,670
What kind of tea is that?
Drowsy-time tea.

960
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:31,523
It detoxifies and cleanses the system.
Now is the moment

961
00:42:31,525 --> 00:42:33,992
when a true detective
digs into his old files.

962
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:37,212
You see everything
with a new light. You'll see.

963
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:40,966
I'm gonna solve three
cases by nightfall.

964
00:42:40,968 --> 00:42:43,501
♪ You and me,
I had to get out ♪

965
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:45,103
♪ And make a deal ♪

966
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,140
♪ And learn to know
how it feels, but that... ♪

967
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,997
♪ Out of my system... ♪

968
00:42:52,022 --> 00:42:54,022
♪ Out of my system... ♪

969
00:42:56,478 --> 00:43:00,478
