1
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:05,673
Good morning.

2
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,844
And to you, as well.

3
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,436
Okay. This has to stop.

4
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:20,638
This only speaking
when spoken to thing?

5
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,402
You're obviously angry that
I went to your friend Alistair

6
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:24,703
and that he told me you knew
someone named Irene.

7
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,321
You think I
overstepped my bounds.

8
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:27,789
Hadn't thought about it
that much at all, actually.

9
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,441
We both know that's not true.

10
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:31,960
And guess what--
I'm your sober companion.

11
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:33,912
It's my job to overstep
polite boundaries.

12
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:36,415
Part of recovery is about
addressing painful things.

13
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,283
If you ignore them,
they become triggers.

14
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:39,951
Could you shoot all this
to me in an e-mail?

15
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:41,837
I'm just much better at
processing the written word.

16
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,177
I'm gonna stay after you
about this,

17
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:46,592
because I know
how important it is.

18
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:48,960
But if you won't talk to me,
there's only so much I can do.

19
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,802
What is it?
You're right.

20
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:00,439
I have been
cutting you off.

21
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,491
It amounts to sulking,

22
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:05,410
and it is no way to conduct
an adult relationship.

23
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:07,245
I might not like what you did,

24
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:08,947
but I suppose I have to...

25
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,116
respect your right to do it.

26
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:14,819
Good.

27
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:17,655
I would propose a toast to our
new spirit of collaboration,

28
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:20,959
but I, um... I've neglected
to pour myself a coffee.

29
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:23,178
Would you mind
waiting a moment?

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,829
Of course.

31
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:40,562
Sherlock?

32
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:46,017
No Watson?

33
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,452
She took the morning off.

34
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:50,071
Something about
a cousin falling ill.

35
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:53,191
Shall we?
Yeah.

36
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:54,826
Jay and Amy Myrose.

37
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:57,162
Their cleaning lady
got here this morning,

38
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,497
found them like this.

39
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,499
Preliminary times of death
indicate the suspect

40
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:02,467
broke in after midnight,

41
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,669
dragged the Myroses
out of their beds,

42
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:08,173
forced them to give up the
combination to their wall safe,

43
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,042
and then...

44
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,644
I, uh... I got to tell you,

45
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,479
coming in here
this morning

46
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:17,382
was like waking up in the
middle of a nightmare

47
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:20,185
that I thought I stopped
having a long time ago.

48
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:22,354
Is that because of the
uncanny similarities

49
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:25,690
to the Wade Crewes
murders in 1999?

50
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,442
You-you know about that?

51
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,494
I picked up the particulars
of these deaths

52
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,530
on my scanner app while
I was taxiing over here.

53
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:34,332
Victims' arms bound
with pile hitch knots,

54
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:36,618
pillows strapped
to their heads using belts

55
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,119
shortly before
they were killed.

56
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:41,840
Have to admit, the
similarities are striking.

57
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,508
Yes, no, no, I know.

58
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,294
I just didn't think you'd
know about Wade Crewes.

59
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:48,964
13 years ago, he perpetrated
three separate home invasions

60
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,215
over the course
of three months.

61
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:51,683
In every instance,
a wealthy couple

62
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:53,218
murdered in the middle
of the night.

63
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,886
Contents of their
wall safe emptied.

64
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:58,356
Eventually, he was brought
to justice by, uh... you.

65
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,608
Yeah.

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,977
Something of a
career-defining case.

67
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,596
Mmm. Of course I'm
familiar with it.

68
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,064
There.

69
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:07,566
Always nice when
a psychopath

70
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:10,235
grooms himself to look the part,
don't you think?

71
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:13,788
Question is,
why copycat a home invader?

72
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,925
You think this is
the work of a copycat?

73
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,578
Well, it's either that, or...

74
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,963
some kind of
weird coincidence.

75
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:23,715
There is another
possibility.

76
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:26,334
But that depends on what
we find in the shoe closet.

77
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:28,620
I noticed something odd
in the old case files.

78
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:31,089
Two of the safes
that Crewes looted

79
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,457
were located in bedroom closets.

80
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,842
The other was in an office,

81
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:35,343
but he rifled through
the bedroom anyway.

82
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:38,346
Now, in each case,
the woman of the house

83
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:39,898
had a collection
of expensive shoes.

84
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,484
And in every case,
one of those shoes

85
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:43,968
was missing
after the murder.

86
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,470
See for yourself.

87
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,106
Why would someone
steal one shoe?

88
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,691
Well, that's a
fair question.

89
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,359
My guess is
the perpetrator

90
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:55,163
wanted a little something
to memorialize the occasion.

91
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:01,620
Something like,
perhaps...

92
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:05,490
one high-heeled
Jimmy Choo.

93
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:13,831
Wade Crewes told you
that he worked alone

94
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,051
when he confessed
in 1999.

95
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,719
I think he lied.

96
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,521
I don't believe that
we're looking for someone

97
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,272
who's copying his work.

98
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:23,909
I think we're looking for
someone who helped him do it.

Wade Crewes, hmm?

We now know

between the old murders

and Crewes is the one man
who can tell us what it is.

115
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,538
Waste of time. He'd tell you he
was partnered with the Taliban

116
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,156
if it'd shave time
off his sentence.

117
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:28,159
And we don't know
there's a connection.

Oh. The missing
high heel.

Don't people lose shoes all the time?
Not $1,000 ones.

I-I have to say, you seem
strangely reluctant

121
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,335
to pursue a
promising lead.

122
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:40,022
Because it's not
a lead yet.

123
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,773
It's not
an anything yet.

Maybe you'll turn out
to be right,

but talking
to Wade Crewes

is not going
to get you there.

I promise you.

Oh.

Watson, I admire
your persistence,

130
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,353
but the reception
is really... where... am.

131
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:57,689
Really? 'Cause my
phone's working fine.

132
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:59,574
Four bars
and everything.

133
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,859
Let me guess:

134
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,328
You want me to wait right here

135
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,697
while you get another coffee.
Or you could just leave.

136
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,882
Okay, I don't think ditching me

137
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,333
is the most
constructive approach.

138
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:09,718
Well, it solved the
problem, didn't it?

139
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,303
It's quite simple, Watson.

140
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,138
Stop trying to reach me,
and things can go back

141
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,307
to the way that they were.
You know I'm not gonna do that.

142
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,142
Well, then, welcome to
our new arrangement.

143
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,428
Same as the old one, without
the goodwill that you'd accrued.

144
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,146
I will obey the letter
of our agreement.

145
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:23,098
I will check in with you
every two hours,

146
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,350
at which point you can give me
whatever drug tests that you want.

147
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:27,819
My bodily fluids are all at your disposal.
That's not how this works...

00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,021
I'm not finished.
Oh, you're not finished.

What is not at your disposal

150
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,690
are the details
of my personal life,

151
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,275
which are uniquely my own,

152
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:35,160
and which I will not cheapen
by allowing them to become

153
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,329
grist for your
tedious recovery mill.

through the Myroses' laptop.

161
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:52,794
They each got a bunch
of threatening e-mails

162
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,346
from the same anonymous account.

163
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,765
We traced the IP address
to a guy named Julian Walsh.

164
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,300
Guy's a contractor.

165
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:00,218
The Myroses hired him
to remodel their kitchen,

166
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,970
and then fired him
six weeks later.

167
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,555
They filed a complaint
about his work

168
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,256
and withheld payment.

169
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:07,526
And Walsh responded
with anonymous threats.

170
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,194
We ran him through the NCIC.

171
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,479
He did time
for weapons possession

172
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,730
and sexual assault.

173
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:14,700
We're going to go
talk to him now.

174
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,451
That's a lead.

175
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,904
"When you least expect it,
I'll be there

176
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:20,372
"to give you what's yours.

177
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,240
"A pair of pliers
and a handful of rusty nails

178
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:23,542
are the only tools I need."

179
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,793
Sound familiar, Mr. Walsh?

180
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,162
Okay, yes, I sent those e-mails.

181
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,081
But that doesn't mean
I killed anybody.

182
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,216
Well, you talked
about killing people,

183
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,451
and they wound up dead.
I'm sure you can follow along.

184
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,387
I don't know
what you want me to say.

185
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,772
Well, listen,

186
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:38,123
we'll be more inclined
to believe you

187
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,558
if you gave us
your whereabouts

188
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,226
between 6:00
and midnight last night.

189
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,862
I watched TV, and then
I went to bed by 11:00.

190
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:46,098
I live alone, but that
doesn't mean I did anything.

191
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,985
You understand why
we're here, Julian.

192
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,937
The people you threatened
in these e-mails are now dead.

193
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,322
Yeah, well...

194
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:57,025
You with us here?
Yep.

195
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,778
I just want to see if
the house has a basement.

196
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,613
Walsh has looked at
the floor three times

197
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:02,998
since he started talking.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,499
He's clearly nervous.

199
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,484
I bet whatever he's
hiding is down there.

200
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:09,621
Okay, I'll cut this off
and get us a warrant.

201
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:11,423
And give him time to
get rid of the evidence?

202
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,324
Mr. Walsh, do you have
a lavatory I might use?

203
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,844
Huh?
Bathroom.

204
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,830
Yeah, upstairs.

205
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,333
Identify yourself.

206
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,399
What the hell are you doing?

207
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,735
He lied.

208
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:16,404
When he said that
he lived alone.

209
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:25,330
Shh.

210
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,921
Arrest him!

211
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,405
Arrest him.
Turn to the wall now.

212
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:38,093
Shh, shh, shh...

213
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:43,581
You have to understand,

214
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,617
this my nuclear option.

215
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:49,087
I've never felt the need to
go to a client's rehab before.

216
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,591
Yeah, but Mr. Holmes
isn't a typical client.

217
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,793
He just won't
let me help him.

218
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:56,761
He's so adamant about
being above all that.

219
00:10:56,763 --> 00:11:00,732
Yeah, he does make it difficult
to keep one's cool, doesn't he?

220
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,984
Please.
Thank you.

221
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:05,403
I know from his records

222
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:08,123
he spent two hours a day
in therapy with you.

223
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,775
Did he ever mention
a woman named Irene?

224
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:14,296
Sherlock Holmes
was here for six months,

225
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:18,049
and in that time,
he mentioned no women, no men,

226
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,784
no names, no dates.

227
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,670
I don't believe I learned

228
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:24,589
a single significant
thing about him.

229
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,907
Her name is Katya.

230
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,410
She came to the U.S.
to work as a prostitute.

231
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,530
Her handlers sold her to Julian
Walsh a couple of weeks ago.

232
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:52,951
She told me that he has been
to see her every night

233
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,119
since he purchased her.

234
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:56,838
You can fill in
the blanks.

235
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,656
Most evenings,
he slept in her room.

236
00:11:58,658 --> 00:12:00,625
Including last night.

237
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:03,428
Walsh's sex slave is his alibi
for the Myrose killings?

238
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,713
I'm afraid it
looks that way.

239
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:06,181
Respectfully,
I suggest that

240
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,882
we bring everyone
on the task force

241
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:10,335
into a comprehensive review
of the original files.

242
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:11,720
Because of the shoe thing?

243
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:13,221
I'm not diverting
an entire task force

244
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,006
for a missing high heel.

245
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:16,507
Four missing high heels,

246
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,893
if you count the
original crime scene.

247
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:21,313
You never recovered the original
murder weapon, did you?

248
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:24,065
No, Crewes said he dumped it
in the East River.

249
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,517
Well, let's go and see
if he was telling the truth.

250
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:29,721
Holmes,

251
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,022
what are we doing
down here?

252
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:32,791
Ballistics comparison, hmm?

253
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,361
This is the original report
from the original murders.

254
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:38,330
You gonna
do it by eye?

255
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:40,832
The human eye
is a precision instrument.

256
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,202
It can detect
grooves and lands on a slug

257
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:47,088
more efficiently
than any computer.

258
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:49,674
In both of these killings,

259
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,476
and in last night's murders,
the slugs had

260
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,728
the same distinctive dent
on the case head.

261
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,481
It was caused by some sort of
defect in the gun's barrel.

262
00:12:56,483 --> 00:13:00,718
The grooves and lands show
a steep twist to the left.

263
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,570
See for yourself.

264
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,557
Now, you can wait
for the computers

265
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,443
to confirm it
if you like,

266
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,561
but Wade Crewes lied to you
about that murder weapon.

267
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:12,080
He didn't dump it.

268
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,999
And wherever it's been
for the last 13 years,

269
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,534
it was used last night
to kill the Myroses.

270
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:20,121
This is no longer a theory,
Captain; this is a fact.

271
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:22,924
These cases are
indelibly linked.

272
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:32,445
Terry?

273
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:33,980
What are you doing here?

274
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:35,265
I figured maybe
you could tell me that.

275
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:36,866
I got a message
saying to come here

276
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:38,201
to review the
Wade Crewes murders.

277
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:39,621
I didn't call you.

278
00:13:39,623 --> 00:13:40,722
I did.

279
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,340
Ms. D'Amico was your partner

280
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:44,342
when you investigated
the original murders in '99.

281
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:46,294
Surely it's possible she
would help shed some light

282
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:47,645
on the situation.

283
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,264
We know that
last night's murders

284
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:51,599
were connected
to the ones from 1999.

285
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:54,068
The way I see it, this can mean
one of two things:

286
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,271
First is that Wade Crewes
had an accomplice

287
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:57,822
that he never told
the police about.

288
00:13:57,824 --> 00:13:59,440
For whatever
reason, that guy

289
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,326
started up again
13 years later.

290
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,027
Second option:

291
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,280
Crewes committed the original
crimes all by himself,

292
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:07,115
but got someone to do
last night's killing

293
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,584
so he could maybe get
his sentence commuted.

294
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:11,152
There is another possibility:

295
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,538
Wade Crewes is innocent,
the wrong man is in prison

296
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,256
and the original killer
is back at it.

297
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:16,541
No way.

298
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:18,793
Crewes did it;
he told us he did it.

299
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:20,578
It wouldn't be the first
false confession in the annals

300
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,846
- of crime, would it?
- Enough.

301
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,431
This isn't philosophy class.

302
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:26,634
We don't need to debate
every possibility.

303
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,338
Whatever's going on, I guarantee
you Crewes is not innocent.

304
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,664
Now, I'm going
to go talk to him,

305
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,099
see if I can shake his tree,

306
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:36,801
figure out if
he's working with somebody.

307
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:39,270
Garrity, Ramberg, I want you
to grab a couple of guys

308
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:41,472
and start digging
into some old case files.

309
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:43,808
Bell, I want you to look
into the suspects from '99.

310
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,060
All right?
We're done here.

311
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:55,953
Um, I'd like to go with
you to interview Crewes.

312
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,705
Fine.
You can observe.

313
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:59,790
Um, not to pry, but
did everything end well

314
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,409
with you and
Detective D'Amico?

315
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:02,910
I noticed that you didn't
greet each other,

316
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,495
you didn't say
good-bye...

317
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:06,997
You just got done dissecting
one of my old cases

318
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,533
in front of a room
full of people.

319
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,586
How about you leave
my old partnership alone.

320
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:17,708
You want insights
into Sherlock Holmes?

321
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,009
I'll give you an insight:

322
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,479
He's childish and self-absorbed.

323
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:24,882
He spent nearly every group
session in total silence.

324
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:26,434
He was, bar none,

325
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:28,152
the least cooperative patient
I've ever had.

326
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:32,189
Yeah, I read the same
from most of your colleagues.

327
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:35,058
Who's that?

328
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,078
Oh, the gardener.

329
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,164
Uh, I think his
name's E... Edson.

330
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,866
Edison?

331
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:44,234
Why?

332
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,036
Hey, there.

333
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:47,538
How you doing?

334
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,756
Good.

335
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:50,674
Hey, is that
beekeeping equipment?

336
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,042
Yeah.

337
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,844
Calms them down.

338
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:56,347
Everyone tells me
I probably should

339
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:57,932
just spray the hives
with poison,

340
00:15:57,934 --> 00:16:01,469
but what can I say?
I find them interesting.

341
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,771
This one's getting
a little big, though.

342
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:06,974
Gonna move it out to the woods.

343
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:09,310
There was a client back here
a little while ago, uh,

344
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,261
who was also interested
in beekeeping.

345
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,947
Sure.

346
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,148
You mean Sherlock.

347
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,866
Yeah.
You knew him?

348
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:18,235
He used to tell me I was
the only person in this place

349
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:19,403
without an agenda.

350
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:21,438
I took that to mean
he liked me.

351
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:24,274
I wasn't sure
if you and your partner

352
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,326
would show up here.

353
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:26,777
You were expecting us?

354
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,162
Of course.

355
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:30,113
We get the newspapers
in here, Detective.

356
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,382
Oh-- wait a minute.

357
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:33,217
It's Captain now, isn't it?

358
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:36,720
I read about last
night's murders.

359
00:16:36,722 --> 00:16:38,639
I knew you'd come see me.

360
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,290
Then I'll cut
right to the chase:

361
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,426
What's the name of the guy
you're working with?

362
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:45,312
I gave up anger
a long time ago.

363
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:48,098
It was one of
the only rational responses

364
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,018
to the irrational situation
my life had become.

365
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,905
But you, standing there,
accusing me...

366
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:58,141
I think that's the perfect test
for my progress, isn't it?

367
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,578
What, exactly, do you have
to be angry about?

368
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,247
As we both well know,
I'm an innocent man.

369
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:06,283
I spent years thinking
about how to prove it,

370
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:08,452
and when I finally
gave up the quest,

371
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:11,005
the world decided
to prove it for me.

372
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:12,873
It's like the man says:

373
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,660
"The strongest of all warriors
are these two:

374
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,596
Time and Patience."

375
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:20,681
Tolstoy's War and Peace.

376
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:22,583
Your file says
you were

377
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:25,636
functionally illiterate when
you confessed to the murders.

378
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:28,606
I had plenty
of raw intelligence.

379
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,941
What I didn't have were
parents or a school system

380
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,226
that gave a damn about me.

381
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:35,062
And my confession,
well, I gave that

382
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:37,398
after my Legal Aid lawyer
convinced me

383
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,950
it was the only way of avoiding
a guaranteed life sentence.

384
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:42,002
He wouldn't take the time
to prove my alibi.

385
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:43,237
Carla Figueroa?

386
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,622
Please.

387
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:46,523
She recanted
the second we asked her

388
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,292
to make an
official statement.

389
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:50,327
Well, of course she did!
Carla was married!

390
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,413
If she admitted she was with me
during the murders, well,

391
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,031
that would be the end
of that, wouldn't it?

392
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,001
We found your fingerprints
at the scene

393
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,220
of the third murders
in '99, remember?

394
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:02,640
You mean you put my prints

395
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:06,176
at the scene
of the third murders in 1999.

396
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:09,379
You and I both know that
evidence was planted.

397
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:12,850
Worked out pretty well for you,
didn't it, Captain?

398
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:17,271
I'm not even
going to respond to that.

399
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,556
The next time you and I
speak to each other,

400
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,192
we'll be standing
on the courthouse steps,

401
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:26,246
after I'm exonerated of
every charge against me.

402
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:33,537
I know he values
his privacy,

403
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,372
but there are some things that
Sherlock needs to deal with,

404
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:36,874
if he really wants
to get better.

405
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:37,908
Are there?

406
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,543
Can you just tell me--

407
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,912
did he ever mention
a woman named Irene?

408
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,098
Can't say he did.

409
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:48,585
Thank you very much
for your time.

410
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:55,275
The name does sound
familiar, though.

411
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:01,098
He left some things behind--
personal stuff.

412
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,653
I held onto it all, just in case
he ever came back for it.

413
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,774
Maybe you can give
these back to him.

414
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:19,383
1020 31st Avenue,
Astoria, Queens.

415
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,085
You want to tell me
why we're here?

416
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:23,620
Last known address
of Carla Figueroa.

417
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,472
I thought we could have
a quick word with her,

418
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:26,890
see if there's anything
to the notion

419
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,792
that she recanted
Wade Crewes's alibi

420
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,145
to save her marriage.

421
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,730
I'm just being thorough.

422
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:35,099
Go right ahead;
I'm just telling you,

423
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:36,934
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back.

424
00:19:36,936 --> 00:19:39,770
Why are you so unwilling to even
consider the possibility

425
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,105
that Crewes is innocent?

426
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:42,439
Is it pride?

427
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:44,942
Because I worked
the case; you didn't.

428
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:47,161
That's precisely why my input
is so valuable.

429
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:49,580
We put Crewes away
on good evidence.

430
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:52,149
His fingerprints were all
over a mug that got broken,

431
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,952
while he was killing
his last two victims.

432
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:56,954
The same mug that he
accused you of planting.

433
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:58,172
Now, when he said that,

434
00:19:58,174 --> 00:19:59,673
you swallowed twice
before responding,

435
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:02,159
like you were trying
to clear your throat, hmm?

436
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,627
And when you
did answer him,

437
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:05,295
your vocal intonation
was markedly different.

438
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:06,764
Now, if I wasn't
watching you,

439
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:08,665
someone I have
the highest respect for,

440
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,801
I would think that that was
the response of someone

441
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:12,970
with something to hide.

442
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:16,473
It sounds like you
think that anyway.

443
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:18,358
My dad's gonna go ape

444
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,860
when he sees you guys
parked in our driveway.

445
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:21,178
Just saying.

446
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,679
We're not going to leave
the car here;

447
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,847
we're with the police.

448
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,616
We need to speak
with Carla Figueroa.

449
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:29,486
Uh, my mom died
four years ago.

450
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,238
Leukemia.

451
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,457
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

452
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,492
My dad's inside, if you
want to talk to him.

453
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:37,544
No, no, no.
It had to be her.

454
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,046
Uh... thanks.

455
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:40,497
Sorry to bother you.

456
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:46,687
Well, if she was lying,
her secret died with her.

457
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:49,256
She wasn't lying.

458
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:52,476
Oh, Wade Crewes,
he put on a good show.

459
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:54,178
Oh, I'll give him that.

460
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,764
But if you really want to
know why I won't waste time

461
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,066
trying to find out if
Wade Crewes is innocent,

462
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,217
watch the tapes.

463
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,819
He held his tongue,

464
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,554
but he couldn't help
gloating about it.

465
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,858
That's the real Wade Crewes.

466
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:14,114
You were
dressed like a house painter.

467
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,701
Eh, doesn't ring a bell.

468
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:20,737
Maybe I should take a look at
those crime scene photos again.

469
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,173
Might jar my memory.

470
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:29,179
Surprised I didn't
see you today, Watson.

471
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:32,266
I sent you a text with my exact
location every two hours.

472
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:33,634
I was busy.

473
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:35,252
I left some urine
in your room.

474
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:38,255
Tell me it's in a cup.

475
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:02,779
Today is April 3, 1999,

476
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,799
and the time is 2200 hours.

477
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:07,634
I'm interviewing Wade Crewes

478
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:11,788
in connection with the deaths
of David and Lyla Dawson.

479
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,124
So, where do we start?

480
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,393
How about with the fact

481
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:18,846
that you used to deliver pizzas
to the Dawsons

482
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,981
back when you were
holding down a job?

483
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:24,101
Is that how
you scouted them out?

484
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:30,974
Black, just like you asked for.

485
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:34,444
Cheers.

486
00:22:43,455 --> 00:22:45,789
We're putting our differences
aside. Come downstairs.

487
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,507
If you need my help,
you know I'm game,

488
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,293
but if this is
some sort of prank...

489
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:51,428
Watson, I think I've learned
something, and if I'm right,

490
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,797
it is bigger than any
dispute between you and me.

491
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,432
It has a moral component.

492
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:58,435
You're good with
that sort of thing.

493
00:22:58,437 --> 00:22:59,937
In the first interrogation
of Wade Crewes,

494
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,522
they served him his coffee
in a disposable cup.

495
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:03,941
In the second
interrogation,

496
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:05,609
they served it to
him in that mug.

497
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:07,311
Black with a white
stripe around the rim.

498
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:09,112
The second interrogation
took place

499
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:10,847
shortly after the
second pair of murders.

500
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,867
At the third crime scene,
they found physical evidence

501
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:15,652
that implicated Wade Crewes.

502
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:19,522
A fingerprint
on a shattered mug.

503
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:24,194
Black with a white stripe
around the rim.

504
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,880
My God, it's
the same mug.

505
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:28,665
The evidence was planted,

506
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:32,252
and it was Captain Gregson
who gave him that mug.

507
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:48,117
I've been struggling
with something.

508
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,319
Oh, good morning
to you, too.

509
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:52,589
Why did you tell me
to look at the tape?

510
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:54,173
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't notice?

511
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:55,708
The mug.

512
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,343
The one that you
handed to Wade Crewes

513
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:58,845
during your second
interrogation of him.

514
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,830
It's the same one
that your men

515
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,715
found at the
third crime scene.

516
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:11,140
I want you to
understand,

517
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:13,776
I take no pleasure in
pursuing this line of inquiry,

518
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:15,862
but I am obliged to
pursue the facts,

519
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:18,114
and the facts are you
and Detective D'Amico

520
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:20,283
had possession of that
mug before it showed up

521
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:21,851
at the third crime scene.

522
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:27,189
As I said yesterday, I have
the utmost respect for you.

523
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:28,958
If evidence was planted,

524
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,711
I'm sure it was the
result of frustration.

525
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:34,163
A mistake that the
perpetrator or perpetrators

526
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:35,915
would no doubt
wish to take back

527
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:37,800
especially now that
it seems possible

528
00:24:37,802 --> 00:24:42,255
that Mr. Crewes may
well be innocent.

529
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:45,207
I don't want to...

530
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:47,427
You know that I will
find out the truth

531
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:51,714
and the truth may well
be... just compromising.

532
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:54,651
Every cop gets offered
a few perks.

533
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:56,903
Free lunch here,
gym membership there.

534
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,906
I never took a single one,

535
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:03,826
and I sure as hell
never planted evidence.

536
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:06,779
Well, then, could you
or your former partner

537
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:08,331
please explain to
me how that mug

538
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,749
showed up at the
crime scene?

539
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,094
Hey.

540
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:28,846
How'd it go?

541
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:31,149
Captain Gregson got
the warning he deserved.

542
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:32,716
Now to solve the case.

543
00:25:32,718 --> 00:25:35,686
Hold on, I...
I've got something for you.

544
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:42,560
You've been to Hemdale.

545
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:44,445
Edson saved them for you.

546
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:47,198
And were they everything
that you hoped, hmm?

547
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,700
Do you understand me now?

548
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:51,502
I didn't read them.

549
00:25:51,504 --> 00:25:52,920
I was tempted.

550
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:54,705
They're from Irene;
how could I not be?

551
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:56,207
But whatever happened,
this is not

552
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:57,842
how I want
to find out about it.

553
00:25:57,844 --> 00:25:59,410
A show of restraint.
When...

554
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:03,514
If you are ready
to talk about it,

555
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,800
I'd very much like to know,

556
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:07,634
but I'm not going to ask you
about it anymore.

557
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,367
I just thought
you might want these.

558
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,036
Indeed I do.

559
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,221
Thank you, Watson.

560
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:23,515
Hey, what are you doing?

561
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,817
I left those at Hemdale
because I didn't want them.

562
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,352
I don't understand.
Aren't those important?

563
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:29,021
Remember your promise:
no further discussion

564
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:30,989
of this matter
until I bring it up.

565
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,776
Fine. Fine.

566
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:36,699
You mentioned something
about a case that needs solving.

567
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,165
This is Victor Nardin.

568
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,400
He was an early suspect
in the '99 home invasions.

569
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:44,369
He's been in prison
for the last 12 years,

570
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:46,505
which could explain why the home
invasions miraculously stopped.

571
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:48,573
He was released
three weeks ago,

572
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,258
which could explain
why they've resumed.

573
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,761
How are the police
not looking for this guy?

574
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:54,596
They are; they just
can't find him.

575
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:57,799
Nardin left his group home on
Staten Island two weeks ago

576
00:26:57,801 --> 00:26:59,918
and has not checked in
with his parole officer.

577
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,520
Those letters are Cyrillic.

578
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:03,021
Is he in a gang or something?

579
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:05,057
No, rabid
football fan.

580
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,275
The tattoos
are the names

581
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,728
and jersey numbers
of famous players

582
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,096
from Terek Grozny.

583
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:13,215
It is Chechnya's
premier football club.

584
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,400
And how are they gonna help us
find Victor Nardin?

585
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,786
I believe they
already have.

586
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,489
Nardin has spent a
decade in prison,

587
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:22,607
bereft of his
favorite obsession.

588
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,994
Wherever he is, he will want
to watch his beloved team.

589
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:28,747
There aren't that
many bars in New York

590
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:31,967
that have a satellite
feed of Chechen football.

591
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:33,719
Three, actually.

592
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:35,871
All of them
in Brighton Beach.

593
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:39,408
All of them within walking
distance of Mayweather Hotel.

594
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,742
"Rooms by the hour,

595
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:42,978
week or month. Cash only."

596
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,351
Yeah. I got a delivery

597
00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:51,103
for one of your guests.
I need a room number.

598
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,470
Victor Nardin.

599
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:55,473
No Nardin?

600
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:57,325
Hold... hold on.

601
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:59,661
Oh, no, no.

602
00:27:59,663 --> 00:28:00,779
I got the wrong name.

603
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,832
Victor Jones.

604
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:06,818
282. Thank you.

605
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,347
Hey.

606
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:23,435
What gives?

607
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:26,438
Tommy, we can't just talk
at the precinct?

608
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,023
Not about this.

609
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,342
You planted that
mug, didn't you?

610
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,395
Yeah.

611
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:37,065
We knew it was him, but
we couldn't nail him.

612
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:39,618
So, after the second time
you brought him in,

613
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,519
you kept that mug

614
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,988
just in case.

615
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,373
Good to have a trump card, huh?

616
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,375
I always assumed you knew that.

617
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,327
I knew it was convenient,

618
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,362
piece of evidence
to turn up like that.

619
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:53,215
I chalked it up
to our good fortune

620
00:28:53,217 --> 00:28:54,625
because I thought
we had our guy.

621
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,585
We did.

622
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:58,670
Well, I was a lot more sure
about that then than I am now.

623
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,922
'Cause somebody is out
there killing people

624
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:03,225
with the same
murder weapon, Terry.

625
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,061
What if we were wrong?

626
00:29:06,063 --> 00:29:08,880
If that were true--
and that is still a big "if"

627
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:11,233
as far as I'm concerned--
there are ways around that.

628
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:14,019
Whoa, I'm not here
to plan a cover-up.

629
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,488
If we put an
innocent man in jail,

630
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,190
I'm not keeping quiet about it.

631
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,658
All right,
let's just forget

632
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,327
about the fact
that I could go to jail.

633
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,063
You worked that
task force in '99.

634
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,199
How do you think that's
going to play for your career?

635
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,617
I'll be done; doesn't matter.

636
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:30,735
If I let this
happen on my watch,

637
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:32,287
I'm owning up to it.

638
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:36,758
Fair warning, partner.

639
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,128
Mr. Jones?

640
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,714
Mr. Jones,
 you have a message

641
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:45,016
from the front desk.

642
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:47,102
He's not here.

643
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:49,754
If I lived here, I
wouldn't be here, either.

644
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,777
Um, should I ask why we're
not calling the police?

645
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:57,729
I found the man.

646
00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:00,949
I just... I just want to have
a look around.

647
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,079
I don't believe it,
but this place smells worse

648
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,914
than the outside.

649
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,499
Stale cigarette smoke,

650
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,668
cheap cologne,

651
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,287
a whiff of
existential despair.

652
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:26,641
This floor is sticky.

653
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:38,653
Evidently, Mr. Nardin
has a drinking problem.

654
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:41,156
He spills his orange juice.

655
00:31:05,348 --> 00:31:07,349
Ah.

656
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,301
What?

657
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:12,187
The carpet has come loose
from the floorboards here.

658
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:13,605
It hasn't come loose from age.

659
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:15,807
Someone has pried this up.

660
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:41,883
Just a minute.

661
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,254
Oh.

662
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:48,473
Captain.

663
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,842
I need you right away.
It's happened again.

664
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:53,645
A triple this time.

665
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:56,898
Neighbor spotted the
body through a window.

666
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,683
I'll be right there.

667
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,986
And, Captain,

668
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,605
I think I might be able
to tell you

669
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:05,940
where the murder weapon is.

670
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:14,941
The homeowners were
Michael and Elizabeth Willis.

671
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:16,805
Everything about
their deaths

672
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:19,190
is consistent
with the others.

673
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:20,642
And the third body?

674
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:22,177
Houseguest, Garret Ames.

675
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:24,129
I don't think the attacker
knew he was here.

676
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:26,214
After the Willises
were shot,

677
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:29,250
there was
a struggle here,

678
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:31,069
and Ames was trying
to get away.

679
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:32,771
Almost made it, too.

680
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:35,657
Killer shot him
from right here.

681
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:41,195
Add another three
to the tally.

682
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:42,864
That's all right,
Captain.

683
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:44,699
I know this
is difficult.

684
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,968
Well, at least CSU
gave us some evidence.

685
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,386
They picked up
some cigarette butts

686
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:49,754
from across the street.

687
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,756
Neighbors saw
someone smoking.

688
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:53,475
They're checking
the place out.

689
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:56,394
Hopefully we'll be able
to harvest some DNA.

690
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,096
We put a BOLO out
for Victor Nardin,

691
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:00,047
and we got a warrant
for his hotel room.

692
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:02,567
If the gun you saw
is the murder weapon,

693
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:03,852
it's beginning

694
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:06,688
to look like an
open-and-shut case.

695
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,606
What is it?

696
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:15,246
You said the killer
shot the houseguest from here.

697
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:17,699
Yeah?
Yeah.

698
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:22,420
Listen, I know you got your
theories about what happened,

699
00:33:22,422 --> 00:33:25,623
but I just want you to know
that if Wade Crewes is innocent,

700
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,292
I'm not going to hide from that.

701
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:31,262
Yeah. Sorry, Captain,
could you just give me a minute?

702
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:34,099
I'm trying to tell you
something important here.

703
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:36,584
Yes, but I wouldn't fall
on my sword just yet.

704
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:42,190
Gregson.

705
00:33:43,993 --> 00:33:46,444
Really?

706
00:33:46,446 --> 00:33:47,679
Yeah?

707
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,864
Okay, yeah.

708
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:51,616
That was Bell.

709
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:54,803
Nardin returned
to his hotel room.

710
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:56,037
We've got him in custody.

711
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,872
Excellent.

712
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:01,242
That should make it easier to
confirm that he didn't do this.

713
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:05,880
I didn't kill those
people, okay?

714
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:08,333
Victor Nardin, think fast.

715
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:09,834
What are you doing?

716
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:11,102
This man is innocent.

717
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:12,837
Detective Bell,
a word, if you please?

718
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,055
Why'd he hit me?

719
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:16,307
Hey, stay right there.

720
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,843
Wait, wait, wait. You assault
our perp with an orange?

721
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:20,929
And that somehow has you
convinced he's innocent?

722
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:23,014
I was testing a hypothesis
I began to form

723
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:24,799
back in Victor Nardin's
hotel room.

724
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,401
It was odd.

725
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:27,735
Everything was
out of alignment.

726
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:29,504
All his toiletries lined up

727
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:30,989
on the left-hand side.

728
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,140
The same was true of
his bedside table, his desk.

729
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:36,027
So he favors his left side.
Big deal.

730
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:38,980
Agreed. Out of context,
it's an utterly mundane detail.

731
00:34:38,982 --> 00:34:41,115
But there were these
distinctive blue marks

732
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:42,700
on the ceiling
above Nardin's bed.

733
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:44,035
The kind of marks

734
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:45,453
a racquetball might make

735
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:47,639
if it was thrown
repeatedly upwards.

736
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:49,824
It's a common exercise
to strengthen depth perception.

737
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,659
The kind of thing
that you might do

738
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:53,461
if you were...
Monocular.

739
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:55,513
You're saying
that he was blind in one eye?

740
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:57,298
In his right eye.

741
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,185
He's learning depth perception.

742
00:35:00,187 --> 00:35:02,804
The man can hardly even pour
his orange juice accurately,

743
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:05,640
let alone hit a moving target
at 20 feet.

744
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:07,775
If he's right,
it would be hard to pull off.

745
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:09,310
In the dark,
with adrenaline

746
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:10,945
coursing through your
system after a fight,

747
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:12,230
I'd say it was impossible.

748
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:14,782
But... we've got evidence.

749
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:16,183
The murder weapon,
the cigarettes...

750
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:18,653
The cigarettes were planted,
obviously.

751
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:20,572
You're standing on a street and
you want to put out a cigarette,

752
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:22,323
how do you do it?
You drop it on the floor.

753
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:23,908
You stand on it.
You flatten it.

754
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,260
The cigarettes that we found
at the crime scene

755
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:26,661
had been ground out.

756
00:35:26,663 --> 00:35:28,663
Victor Nardin put them out
in an ashtray.

757
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:30,197
Someone took them
from his hotel room,

758
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,966
transported them
to the crime scene,

759
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,219
and they put the gun beneath the
floorboards before they left.

760
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:37,005
Oh, so now Nardin's
been framed, too.

761
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:38,372
I think that's a fair question.

762
00:35:38,374 --> 00:35:40,008
The only obvious culprit

763
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,876
would be the one man
who stood to benefit

764
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,928
from someone else being
implicated in the crimes.

765
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,098
Wade Crewes, working in tandem
with someone on the outside.

766
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,382
Someone with
whom he shared

767
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:50,384
the location
of the murder weapon,

768
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:52,553
the details
of the murders in '99.

769
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:54,606
By law, he has access
to his case files.

770
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:57,158
He could see a list of suspects,
pick a man to frame.

771
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,660
You've spent the past 72 hours

772
00:35:58,662 --> 00:36:00,278
insisting Crewes is innocent.

773
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,913
I've been insisting that
there's a connection.

774
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:03,281
And I'm right.

775
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:05,583
The framing of Nardin
is the final stroke

776
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:08,786
in a plan that leads to
Wade Crewes walking free.

777
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:10,872
We've got five dead bodies.

778
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:13,558
Who would be willing to do that
for a guy like Crewes?

779
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:16,294
I have no idea.

780
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:18,146
Then you've got nothing.

781
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:20,515
Believe me, no one
wants you to be right

782
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:22,267
about this more than me.

783
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,052
All you've done
is scare up

784
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:25,920
a bunch of
circumstantial evidence

785
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,605
that might or might not mean

786
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:30,091
Nardin's been framed
by Crewes' mystery partner.

787
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:31,442
And if you're right,

788
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:33,728
we better identify
that partner fast,

789
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,363
'cause if we don't,

790
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:37,198
Nardin's going to eat
these charges,

791
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,450
and then Crewes walks.

792
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:41,268
The police commissioner

793
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,104
declined comment today
on the possibility

794
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:45,373
that a pair of violent
home invasions

795
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,842
may signal the innocence
of the notorious Wade Crewes.

796
00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:49,276
According to
prison records,

797
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:50,979
Crewes hasn't had
a visitor in years.

798
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,880
He hasn't sent a letter,
he hasn't received one.

799
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:55,083
No phone calls, either.

800
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:58,186
Maybe he's collaborating
with an old cellmate?

801
00:36:58,188 --> 00:36:59,971
Doubtful.

802
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:03,124
Crewes's one and only cellmate
is serving life without parole.

803
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:04,592
Whoever he's working with,

804
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:06,394
he's willing to kill for him.

805
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:09,630
This is no casual acquaintance.

806
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:12,483
So have we been over all
of Crewes's relatives?

807
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:14,352
Crewes was raised
in group homes.

808
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:15,903
He doesn't even know
his own parents.

809
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:17,438
You seem remarkably calm
for someone

810
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,324
who claims to have spent
13 years in jail

811
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:20,575
for crimes he didn't commit.

812
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:22,660
"Things are what they are,

813
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:24,896
and will be what they will be."

814
00:37:24,898 --> 00:37:27,582
Oscar Wilde.

815
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:29,200
What?

816
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,953
Crewes is quoting
Oscar Wilde.

817
00:37:31,955 --> 00:37:34,255
When he went to prison,
he was illiterate.

818
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:37,041
Now he quotes Wilde
and Tolstoy.

819
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:40,511
He's not just reading.

820
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:42,930
He's reading at
an advanced level.

821
00:37:42,932 --> 00:37:45,499
Records.

822
00:37:52,307 --> 00:37:56,144
Someone must have
taught him how to read.

823
00:37:57,512 --> 00:38:01,366
There is no record of
him taking any classes.

824
00:38:01,368 --> 00:38:03,034
Whoever taught him

825
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:05,069
must have spent quite
a bit of time with him.

826
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:07,372
Lots of chats.
Time to plan.

827
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:08,990
You just said he
didn't take a class.

828
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:10,291
But he did
have a job.

829
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:11,692
A couple of years ago,

830
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:14,045
he signed up to work
at the prison library.

831
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:16,914
You think someone who worked
there taught him how to read?

832
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,883
Maybe.

833
00:38:18,885 --> 00:38:21,836
I seem to remember
that the library at Sing Sing

834
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,372
was on the verge of being
shut down a few years ago.

835
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:30,228
Yes. See?

836
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,562
It only stayed open

837
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:33,431
because a volunteer
advocacy group

838
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:37,018
agreed to fund the library
and keep it staffed.

839
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:45,443
"Literacy Initiative
for All"-- LIFA.

840
00:38:45,445 --> 00:38:48,062
I've seen those initials
recently.

841
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:54,001
You know him?

842
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:58,739
He's the son of
Carla Figueroa.

843
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:01,809
The woman Crewes
had an affair with.

844
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:07,432
Sean Figueroa?

845
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:09,133
Yeah.

846
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:10,718
You're that guy.

847
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,019
From outside
my house, right?

848
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:13,471
Yeah. Sherlock Holmes.

849
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:14,722
Consulting detective.

850
00:39:14,724 --> 00:39:17,108
This is Mr. Bell,

851
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,727
frequent beneficiary
of said consultations.

852
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:20,817
How can I help you?

853
00:39:20,842 --> 00:39:22,766
You ever wonder why you
have such blue eyes, Sean?

854
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:24,198
You must have.

855
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,317
Both of your parents
are of Mexican descent,

856
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:29,737
yet there you are, eyes as blue
as the fjords of Norway.

857
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,539
Why do you want to
know about my eyes?

858
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,658
Because that's what first
led me to believe

859
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,710
that Wade Crewes
is your father.

860
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:37,328
I suppose I'm just
wondering if

861
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,280
that's how you arrived
at the same conclusion.

862
00:39:39,282 --> 00:39:41,082
I don't know what
you're talking about,

863
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:42,884
but I'm busy, so...

864
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:44,886
Your mother had a long-standing
affair with Crewes.

865
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:47,054
I suppose, when she
fell pregnant with you,

866
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:49,623
it was easy enough to pass
you off as your father's son.

867
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,142
But, uh...

868
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:52,793
can't imagine
she told you.

869
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:54,896
You did find out, though.

870
00:39:54,898 --> 00:39:56,764
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have begun volunteering

871
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:59,433
at the prison library,
where he works.

872
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:01,769
Huh?

873
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:03,571
You can lie
all you want, Sean.

874
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:05,173
It'll be easy enough
to establish paternity.

875
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:06,607
Okay.

876
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:07,909
So what if he is my dad?

877
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:09,443
How did you find out?

878
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:11,478
My mom kept a diary.

879
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,364
My dad didn't know
where it was hidden,

880
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:14,699
but I did.

881
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:16,501
After she died,
I read the whole thing.

882
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:17,835
You must have
been curious

883
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:19,537
about your
real father, yeah.

884
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:21,255
The notorious killer.

885
00:40:21,257 --> 00:40:24,425
So you volunteered.

886
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:26,677
Probably just observed
for a while,

887
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,096
then you struck up
a relationship.

888
00:40:29,098 --> 00:40:31,883
At some point,
you revealed the connection.

889
00:40:31,885 --> 00:40:34,886
And that's when Crewes
went to work on you. Yeah?

890
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:36,470
How long did it take him

891
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:38,606
to seduce you? Hmm?

892
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:39,891
How long did it take him

893
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:42,059
to talk you into killing
on his behalf?

894
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:43,361
I taught him how to read.

895
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,029
That's how it
started, yeah.

896
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:46,697
But there's more
than a little bit

897
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:48,482
of your father in you,
isn't there, Sean?

898
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:50,067
Yeah.

899
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:51,903
Enough for you
to murder five people.

900
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:53,404
You must know
your father

901
00:40:53,406 --> 00:40:54,705
pretty well by now, hmm?

902
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,374
How do you think
he's going to respond

903
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:57,491
when my colleagues
approach him

904
00:40:57,493 --> 00:40:59,126
with a deal
to reduce his sentence

905
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:00,878
in exchange for the name
of his accomplice?

906
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,463
I'm done with this.
How loyal do you think

907
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:03,798
your father's
going to be

908
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,633
when you're next
on the chopping block

909
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:07,368
and he's got freedom
at his fingertips?

910
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,420
Hmm?

911
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:11,672
Is he going to hesitate
for even a second

912
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:14,208
before he renounces you?

913
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:17,228
Will he visit you
in prison?

914
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,743
What are those?

915
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:34,078
Your trophies.

916
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,831
From each of
the crime scenes in 1999.

917
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,449
$1,000 shoes.

918
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,369
Your son told us
where you hid them.

919
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:43,070
Same place you
stashed that pistol.

920
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:44,455
What are you
talking about?

921
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:45,840
I don't have a son.

922
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:47,959
His name is Sean Figueroa,

923
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:50,011
and he has
a quite compelling story.

924
00:41:50,013 --> 00:41:52,179
Five new murders, Wade.

925
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:53,881
Sean's going away,

926
00:41:53,883 --> 00:41:56,634
and you're getting five
new conspiracy charges.

927
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:00,438
No.

928
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,556
You-you framed me.

929
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,525
You bastard, you framed me.
Hey, hey, back up!

930
00:42:04,527 --> 00:42:06,227
I'm only in here because of you!
Hey, Crewes, that's enough.

931
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:07,857
You framed me, you bastard!
Back in your cell.

932
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,341
You framed me!

933
00:42:10,098 --> 00:42:12,199
Satisfying?

934
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:14,201
You have no idea.

935
00:42:22,995 --> 00:42:25,696
I'm going to bed.

936
00:42:25,698 --> 00:42:28,082
Good night.

937
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:30,434
She died.

938
00:42:30,436 --> 00:42:32,953
♪

939
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:37,425
Irene?

940
00:42:40,595 --> 00:42:42,847
We were quite close.

941
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:46,067
I did not take
her passing well.

942
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:51,439
Good night.
