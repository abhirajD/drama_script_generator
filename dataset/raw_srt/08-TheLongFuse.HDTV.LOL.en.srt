1
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:13,319
Don't you ever get tired
of this memory game?

2
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,888
You do it every morning.
The mind is a muscle, Watson.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,058
It needs to be exercised
regularly lest it turn flabby.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,194
Most people
just read a book.

5
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:22,863
I am reading a book.

6
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:24,915
Well, do you mind
turning it off for a minute?

7
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:27,084
I want to finish our
conversation from last night.

8
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,588
Okay, I meant
all of them.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,590
Absorbing and cataloguing
several pieces of information

10
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,909
at the same time
is the whole point.

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,844
Talk away.

12
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:40,097
Okay, well, then I want us
to get more serious

13
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,581
about finding a sponsor.

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,250
Why do I need a sponsor
when I have a companion?

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,269
Because you only have me
for a few more weeks.

16
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:48,271
A sponsor is permanent,
someone who's...

17
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,023
struggled with their
own addictions

18
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:52,392
and is gonna offer you
lifelong support and advice,

19
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:53,860
which is what you need.

20
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,814
The drugs that I took
seemed to light up my brain.

21
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:59,616
Suddenly I realized

22
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:02,602
the power I held,
the power to rule,

23
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,372
to make the world grovel
at my feet.

24
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:11,611
The drugs I took seemed
to light up my brain.

25
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,948
Suddenly I realized
the power I held,

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,383
the power to rule,

27
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:19,302
to make the world grovel
at my feet.

28
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:20,921
Okay.

29
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:23,122
Well, I know someone
who might be a good fit for you.

30
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,424
I've worked with him before.

31
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,976
Let's have coffee
with him, okay?

32
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,762
If I needed a sponsor,
that would sound delightful.

33
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:31,681
I don't. Just like I didn't
need a sober companion.

34
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:32,983
And you didn't need rehab

35
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:34,501
and you didn't
need drug counseling

36
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:36,186
and you didn't need
any help of any kind.

37
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,405
I know.

38
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:40,607
It's just coffee.

39
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:43,109
Sherlock.
Fine. I'll go.

40
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,412
Provided I can get some peace
and quiet around here.

41
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:54,254
We completely
understand, Mr. McKeon.

42
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:55,321
Fluid layout.

43
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,957
No, we-we agree, uh...

44
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,177
grid-based design, it's gone
the way of the dinosaur.

45
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:02,562
Will do.

46
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:04,831
All right. Take care.

47
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,601
Our favorite client's
still wringing his hands?

48
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:09,219
Guy just does not get
Web design.

49
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:12,522
'Course, he's like 45
or something.

50
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:18,845
Is that you?

51
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,780
No.

52
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,653
I think it's coming
from inside the vent.

53
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,829
Yeah, repair guy must have
dropped his phone or something.

54
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:38,164
That's going
to make us crazy.

55
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,417

The bomb squad's
working on it.

66
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:41,023
All they know
for sure is that

67
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,608
the bomb was stashed
in that air vent.

68

Both of the victims were
employees of this company?

Parabolic Web Industries.

with the firm.

73
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,422
Captain?

74
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:15,474
I imagine you won't miss this
when you're gone.

75
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:19,478
In a few weeks,
you'll be with your new client.

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,615
No more crime scenes,
no more death and destruction.

77
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:25,985
Most dangerous place you'll go
is a support group meeting

78
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:28,287
where they've run out of coffee.

79
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,190
Firstly, I don't have
a next client, and secondly,

80
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:33,993
you're right, I'm not gonna
miss seeing this stuff.

81
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,706
You see this?

82
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,891
That's packing paper.

83
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:50,926
It's used to fill the gap

84
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,312
between the fuel and the
blast cap on a pipe bomb.

85
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:55,214
When the bomb detonates,

86
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:56,982
this paper is ejected
through the barrel

87
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:58,901
before it has time
to fully combust.

88
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:02,054
Now, weapons-grade munitions
uses pulp filler,

89
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:04,223
not newspaper.

90
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:05,991
The bomb squad
said the same thing.

91
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:07,276
We're already
running a check

92
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:08,828
on recent
commercial burglaries

93
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,163
to see if
anyone's missing

94
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:15,584
any flammable chemicals
or gunpowder.

95
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:17,569
You got something?

96
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,538
Motherboard.

97
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,624
You know this is
a computer company, right?

98
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:23,425
Well, that's just it, Detective.

99
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:25,127
This is not from a computer.

100
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,545
It's from a pager.

101
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:28,214
Note the presence of a receiver

102
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:30,349
but the absence
of a transmitter.

103
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,469
What's it doing here?

104
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,855
Pre-explosion, this place looked
like the deck of a starship.

105
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,556
It's unlikely any of
the firm's employees

106
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:40,809
would use technology
as antiquated as a pager.

107
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:42,611
You're saying
it's part of the bomb?

108
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:45,264
I'm saying this may be
the bomb's detonator.

109
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,432
The good news is, if it's
not too badly damaged,

110
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,702
you'll be able to trace
the account.

111
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:52,788
I'll get this
to tech assist right away.

112
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,457
I'll let you know
when we hear something.

113
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,293
If the motherboard
is still functional, how long

114
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,545
do you think it's gonna take
the police to get a number?

115
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,747
Two, maybe three hours. Why?

116
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,917
The sponsor's name is Adrian,

117
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,002
and he works on the floor
of the stock exchange.

118
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:08,170
Good thinking, Watson.

119
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,755
You know how much
I enjoy bankers.

120
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:11,090
Glad to see
you've been paying attention

121
00:06:11,092 --> 00:06:12,474
over the last few weeks.

122
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:14,760
Actually, he's an officer
with the SEC.

123
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:17,146
So he spends his days
keeping bankers in line.

124
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:20,399
He also spent four years at
the London School of Economics,

125
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,634
so he knows
your old stomping grounds.

126
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:25,020
You think I'd just pick any name
out of a hat? Oh, there he is.

127
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:26,989
Hey, Adrian.

128
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,825
Hi. Adrian, Sherlock.

129
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,777
Pleasure.

130
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:36,148
Well, you guys talk.

131
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,450
I'll be over there
when you're ready.

132
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:43,956
A hypothetical, Adrian.

133
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,624
I call you in the middle
of the night,

134
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:46,959
I tell you that I'm thinking
of using again,

135
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,493
and that if I don't,
I might die.

136
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,712
How do you respond?

137
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,463
Well, Sherlock,
I think I'd start

138
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,882
by reminding you, you got
to take it one day at a time,

139
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:55,634
and that every clean
day is a victory.

140
00:06:55,636 --> 00:06:57,886
I call you and tell you
that an enemy has poisoned me

141
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:59,521
with a powerful
neuroleptic agent.

142
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,724
The only antidote is a
healthy dose of diphenhydramine,

143
00:07:01,726 --> 00:07:03,008
of which I have plenty.

144
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,526
Do you advise me to take it?

145
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:05,861
Diphen...

146
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,313
Diphenhydramine.

147
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:09,982
You find
murder-by-poisoning humorous?

148
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:11,516
No, of course not. I just...

149
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:13,535
The diphenhydramine,
Adrian, do I take it?

150
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,956
If it's gonna save your life,

151
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,241
then yeah, of course you do.

152
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,236
That's your idea of a
good fit, seriously?

153
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:33,672
I told you, he's one
of the best sponsors I know.

154
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:36,041
Peter Platitude? I was waiting
for him to hold my hand

155
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:37,710
so we could recite
the Serenity Prayer.

156
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,979
Okay, if you want to hear
something other that platitudes,

157
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,181
try listening to the guy
for more than two minutes.

158
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:44,900
The man encouraged me to take
diphenhydramine, Watson.

159
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:46,285
A deliriant.

160
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:47,936
The Republic of Zambia
recently classified that

161
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:49,521
a controlled substance.

162
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:51,556
Now, what kind of a sponsor
would allow his sponsee

163
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,258
to risk their sobriety
over a simple case

164
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,493
of neuroleptic poisoning?

165
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:55,828
Okay, you think I don't know

166
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,563
there's no right answer
to that question?

167
00:07:57,565 --> 00:07:58,998
You don't want Adrian?

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,432
Okay. This is a process.

169
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,284
We can look for other candidates
at group tonight.

170
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:04,453
We are gonna
find you a sponsor

171
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:06,338
before my stint is up, okay?

172
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,210
Ha.

173
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,244
Captain.

174
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,712
That motherboard you found--

175
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:15,514
bomb squad confirmed
it was part of the device,

176
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,915
so touché.

177
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,600
The pager it was part of
was prepaid,

178
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,152
so there was no subscriber info,

179
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:22,271
but luckily, the tech assist

180
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:23,939
was able to pull
a number off it.

181
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,258
And the same phone
called the pager

182
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,810
three times this morning,

183
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:30,762
and each call was within seconds
of the bomb going off.

184
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:32,614
Were you able
to trace the number?

185
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:36,101
Yeah, to a plumber
named Rennie Jacobs from Queens.

186
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:38,604
And get this,
he just did a six-year stretch

187
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:39,771
for burning down his apartment

188
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,940
in an insurance fraud scheme.

189
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,459
Any particular reason

190
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,411
he'd want to depredate
that Web design firm?

191
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,963
No clue, but, uh,
if you want to see him

192
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,382
live and in person,
he just got here.

193
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:51,800
I was just trying
to call in

194
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,635
a breakfast sandwich order,
that's it.

195
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:55,888
Three times you called
that pager, Mr. Jacobs.

196
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,289
Three times.

197
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,808
You said the pager number
was 555-0164, right?

198
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,143
212 area code?

199
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:04,463
I was trying to call
Miracle Deli on 113th.

200
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:05,898
Their number is off

201
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,068
by one digit. 0165.

202
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,481
I must've misdialed, 'cause
when they didn't answer,

203
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,022
I hit redial.

204
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:15,307
Twice.

205
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:17,109
Miracle Deli.
Pickup or delivery?

206
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:18,977
He's telling the truth

207
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:20,829
about the numbers being off
by a single digit.

208
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,498
Yeah, we know.

209
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,117
Coincidence bugs me, but not
enough to cut him loose.

210
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,587
I got to step out.

211
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:30,372
Bomb squad wants to brief me.

212
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:37,212
You don't look convinced.

213
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:39,798
Bomb-building
is a dangerous venture.

214
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,850
It requires patience,
precision,

215
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,852
attention to detail.

216
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:46,221
Mr. Jacobs' wristwatch
is nine minutes slow

217
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:48,223
and his fly
is three-quarters down.

218
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:51,610
That doesn't scream
detail-oriented.

219
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:54,279
Ted Kaczynski looked like
a hobo puked another hobo.

220
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,698
He managed
to hurt plenty of people.

221
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,035
Point taken.

222
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,157
Yeah.

223
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:08,427
Can I help you?

224
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,245
This is the, uh...

225
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:12,414
the bomb's power source,
I presume?

226
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,966
Six volt.

227
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:16,084
Very interesting company,
PrimSource Battery.

228
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:18,170
Founded in 1888
by British expat

229
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:19,805
and purveyor
of mechanical novelties,

230
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,340
Hubert Primler.

231
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:24,426
They switched to making
batteries full-time in 1907,

232
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,428
each one stamped
with the company's

233
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,647
now iconic rising-sun logo.

234
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,849
The logo remained unchanged
until 2008,

235
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:32,717
when a small oak tree was added

236
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,653
to commemorate
the company's centenary.

237
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:37,239
Yet this one has no oak tree.

238
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:39,274
That means that battery

239
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:41,076
is more than four years old.

240
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:44,246
Odd, isn't it,
go to all that trouble

241
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:45,730
building an elaborate
explosive device

242
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,249
and then power it with an old

243
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:48,750
and potentially
unreliable battery?

244
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:51,053
Odd, yes,
but not impossible.

245
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:53,589
Holmes, Holmes,
I've only got a few minutes here

246
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:55,290
to pick Bennett's brain
before I have

247
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,741
to stand in front
of 20 cameras

248
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:57,909
to explain what happened
this morning.

249
00:10:57,911 --> 00:10:59,928
What about that?
What about what?

250
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,763
It's the president.

251
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:03,932
Wrong. It's the senator.
Captain...

252
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,517
Senator Obama,
not President Obama.

253
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,769
You can tell from the lack
of gray in his hair.

254
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:10,189
He's right. I can make
out a date on this one.

255
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,224
October 13, 2008.

256
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:13,725
So, what are you saying?

257
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:15,194
That battery is four years old.

258
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,613
These shreds of newspaper
are four years old.

259
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:20,065
The bomb that exploded
this morning was four years old.

260
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,533
But why would the suspect
build a bomb

261
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:22,951
and sit on it for four years?

262
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:24,703
He wouldn't have.

263
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,371
And in Rennie Jacobs's case,
he couldn't have.

264
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:27,823
He was in prison
four years ago.

265
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:29,408
I think he was telling the truth

266
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,376
when he said he dialed
the wrong number this morning.

267
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:34,713
We have the man who set it off
accidentally in 2012.

268
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:38,834
Now we just need the man who
intended to set it off in 2008.

269
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:46,238
You're sure he's not the
one who built the bomb?

270
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,443
Sure? No.

271
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:49,111
Reasonably certain? Yeah.

272
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,596
The NYPD can continue
to poke and prod him.

273
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:53,715
In the meantime,
you and I can push forward

274
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,617
on this, our new front.

275
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:58,537
It is a lovely front.

276
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,489
Hmm. Vanowen
Strategic Communications.

277
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:03,492
Public relations consultancy
founded in 1994

278
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:06,879
by Harrington School of Business
alumna Heather Vanowen.

279
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,464
The firm is particularly adept
at solving image crises

280
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,216
of the corporate variety,

281
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:14,553
making them one-stop shopping
for many of the Fortune 500.

282
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:18,307
Spin doctors
of the highest order, and

283
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,458
former tenants
of the midtown offices

284
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,961
ravaged by a homemade bomb
this morning.

285
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:25,564
They occupied the space
until December 2008.

286
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,517
Now, if I'm right and the bomb
was planted that October,

287
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,686
this company
or one of its employees

288
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:33,138
may have been
the intended target.

289
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,741
Mr. Holmes?

290
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,159
Heather Vanowen.

291
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,810
This is Earl Wheeler, my CFO.

292
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:42,164
We were told you work
with the police.

293
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,648
I'm their consultant.

294
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,000
This is Miss Watson.

295
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:47,252
She is my consultant,
slash housekeep.

296
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:48,837
So, how can we
help you today?

297
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,655
Well, you can start
by telling us

298
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:53,876
who maybe have wanted
to blow you up in 2008.

299
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,962
I'm stunned.

300
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:58,547
I-I saw the story
on the news this morning.

301
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,083
I knew that was our old
office space, but...

302
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,218
I never would have guessed
that that bomb

303
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,337
- was meant for us.
- So you honestly think

304
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,672
it was just sitting
there this whole time?

305
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,841
The police think it was tucked
into an air vent.

306
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:11,610
If that part of the building's
climate control system

307
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,362
had never needed repair--

308
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:15,614
and judging by this morning's
events, it didn't--

309
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:17,866
it could have gone
undiscovered indefinitely.

310
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:20,035
Okay, but why this morning?

311
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:21,954
Why'd it go off
after all this time?

312
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,521
The bomb was detonated
by a pager.

313
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:27,209
In 2008, the company
that made that pager

314
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:31,413
had no signal towers within
42 blocks of your old offices.

315
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,048
In 2010,

316
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,667
they erected a new tower

317
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,552
a mere three blocks away.

318
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:39,371
So the bomb didn't detonate

319
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:41,673
in 2008 because the call
couldn't go through.

320
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,209
The question is:
Who built the device,

321
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:46,845
and what may they have had
against your company?

322
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,563
I'm sure that we've made
our fair share of enemies

323
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:50,732
along the way, but, um...
someone who would build

324
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,184
a bomb?

325
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,436
The ELM.

326
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:57,055
The Earth Liberty Militia.

327
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,607
We got some threatening letters
from them in 2008.

328
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,993
They're an ecoterrorist
group, right?

329
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:02,778
They've bombed a few other
companies over the years.

330
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,664
What would an ecoterrorist group
have against a PR firm?

331
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,783
Our clients.

332
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:10,235
We work with some of
the major energy conglomerates.

333
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:11,586
Occasionally we
have to help them

334
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:13,171
smooth over their
image after mishaps.

335
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:15,407
200 million gallons of oil

336
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,342
spilling into the Gulf,
for example?

337
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,845
The ELM sent us
seven letters in 2008.

338
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:21,947
I know that we kept hard copies
of them in our records room.

339
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,181
You want to take a look?

340
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:24,850
We would.

341
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:29,972
Effluvium, fussbudget, Cairo.

342
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:32,891
Nine across,
14 down, 32 down.

343
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:36,278
I-I have a sort of thing
for puzzles.

344
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,284
When I first tried
getting clean,

345
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:43,785
I started drinking.

346
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:46,371
Before long, I realized
that I had swapped

347
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:47,789
one addiction
for another.

348
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,241
Please put those away.

349
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,426
"You cannot stop this.
You can only submit.

350
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:53,728
Submit or be destroyed""

351
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,032
That's something
the ELM would say.

352
00:14:57,034 --> 00:14:58,283
Here...

353
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,285
Not the time,
not the place.

354
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,954
I'm sorry, but from a forensic
linguistics standpoint,

355
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,573
these threats are
quite fascinating.

356
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:07,626
For example, I see clues here
that would suggest

357
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:10,712
that the ELM was not
an organization, per se,

358
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:13,965
but one man posing
as an organization

359
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:17,302
Seriously, can you just
examine those at home?

360
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,920
We have work
to do here.

361
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:21,223
Oh, yeah.
Sponsor Search 2012.

362
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:23,225
I have to say, Watson,

363
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:25,460
it's a bit of
a motley crew tonight.

364
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:27,596
I don't think these are
my kind of addicts.

365
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:30,649
I think this is going to be
a much longer

366
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,851
and more involved process
than we initially thought.

367
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:35,136
You have 23 days.

368
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:37,072
Then our time is up.

369
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:41,109
My name is Alfredo,
and I'm an addict.

370
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,810
Hi, Alfredo.

371
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:46,331
Started boosting cars
when I was 14.

372
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,699
By the time I turned 18,

373
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,784
I was the best there is.

374
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:51,953
Ain't a car in the city
I can't steal.

375
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:53,455
Him.

376
00:15:53,457 --> 00:15:54,756
Hmm?
Now I'm flush with cash,

377
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:56,925
I'm bored... I turn to drugs.

378
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,878
I want him to
be my sponsor.

379
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,546
Took my first hit at 19...

380
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:07,168
This phrase,
"on your beam ends,"

381
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,688
it appears in five
of the seven threats.

382
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,023
I'm certain I've heard
it before; I just...

383
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,441
can't recall where.

384
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,726
"On your beam ends."

385
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:16,394
A nautical idiom
first documented

386
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,780
in Captain Frederick
Marryat's 1830 novel

387
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:20,448
The King's Own,

388
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,367
signifying a situation
of great peril.

389
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:24,486
Strange for such
an aberrant phrase

390
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:25,820
to appear so repeatedly.

391
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:29,040
Are you seriously
going to make me ask?

392
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:31,293
Ask what?
About your sponsor, Alfredo.

393
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:32,961
Delightful fellow.

394
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:34,462
He's agreed to meet us
both tomorrow for coffee.

395
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:36,464
So we can get to
know one another.

396
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:37,966
You don't approve?

397
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:39,968
I'm just a little confused,
that's all.

398
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,386
I mean, you actually met Adrian.

399
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:43,037
You talked to him
before you turned him down.

400
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,757
You heard Alfredo speak
for 15 seconds.

401
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,542
Oh, have you not
figured out by now

402
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:50,312
that I see far more
than your average addict?

403
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:52,046
My observational skills
are second to none.

404
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,882
I know. I know that.
I just... I want to leave you

405
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,185
in the best situation possible.
It's important to me.

406
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:59,104
Got it.
Good. I'm glad.

407
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,772
No. "On your beam ends""

408
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,223
I've got it.

409
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:05,193
I know where I was
when I heard it.

410
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,415
That one.

411
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,900
That's where I saw it,
weeks ago.

412
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:15,453
But what was the context?

413
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,258
Yellow cartoon sponge man,

414
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,077
sports news,
mouthwash advert,

415
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,933
Arctic Blue...

416
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,247
You want to tell me
what you're doing?

417
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:27,582
Uh, method of loci,
mnemonic device.

418
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,268
Relies on memorized spatial
relationships to establish,

419
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,105
catalogue and recollect
memorial content.

420
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:37,142
If I remember what was
on these six screens,

421
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:40,228
I'll remember what
was on the seventh.

422
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,767
Fat lady, new cookbook,
insufferable.

423
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,952
Erectile dysfunction.
Nature program, penguins.

424
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:50,655
And... talk show.

425
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:53,875
The topic was...
international whaling laws.

426
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:57,629
Two guests got into an argument.

427
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,755
You are not seriously suggesting

428
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:09,257
that cleaning out the
Pacific Ocean is a good idea.

429
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:10,642
What do you suggest
we tell the Japanese worker

430
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,110
whose livelihood
depends upon this trade?

431
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:14,262
Just... you don't get it.

432
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:17,131
One day 50 yrs from now,
when you're on your beam ends,

433
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,851
you'll wish you'd done
more when you could have.

434
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:22,153
That's the same bombast

435
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:23,571
I read in the ELM letters.

436
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:24,856
It's the same hyperbole.

437
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,157
Same weird phrase.

438
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,909
You really think it's him?

439
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:29,477
I know a way to find out.

440
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,329
I'm confused, Detective.

441
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:34,999
You're accusing me of being
some sort of ecoterrorist?

442
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,202
One of our special consultants

443
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:40,205
thinks your speech pattern
is a match for these letters.

444
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:41,923
For the last time,

445
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:43,991
I have never seen
these letters before.

446
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:46,327
I don't know anything
about the ELM,

447
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:48,329
and I certainly didn't
build any bombs.

448
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:51,566
Lie, lie and lie.

449
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,101
Who the hell are you?

450
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:55,220
I am the man with the button.

451
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,105
It's from the elevator
down the hall.

452
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:59,006
You pushed it
to get to this floor.

453
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:01,008
As soon as you disembarked,
I removed it,

454
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,344
and took it to the department's
latent print unit.

455
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,480
It has your fingerprint
on it, you see.

456
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,866
Which means it has
a great deal in common

457
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:10,985
with a component
from a bomb the ELM detonated

458
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:14,322
in a lumber mill
in Utica in 2005.

459
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,158
Button... bomb.

460
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,627
Button...
bomb.

461
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,247
The similarities are quite
striking, wouldn't you agree?

462
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:24,048
You built the ELM bombs,
Mr. Knowles.

463
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,667
And you wrote
those letters.

464
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:27,552
It's too bad you didn't
go back for the one

465
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,971
you left at Vanowen S.C. when
you realized it was defective.

466
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:32,474
Maybe you wouldn't be facing
two murder charges today.

467
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:36,644
I bombed that lumber mill.

468
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,316
And I wrote these letters
to Vanowen S.C.

469
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,601
But you know what I didn't do?

470
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:44,986
Follow up on them.

471
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:48,523
By 2008, I had
successfully detonated

472
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:51,609
nitrate-based bombs at
five different companies.

473
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:55,229
I was established,
and I was taken very seriously.

474
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:58,449
Vanowen S.C. was one of
several dozen businesses

475
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:00,568
I threatened but never bombed.

476
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,037
Why am I not surprised
you'd take credit

477
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,739
for every bombing except

478
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,926
the one that
killed two people?

479
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:09,627
Was that you?

480
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:11,462
Was what me?

481
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,251
What did those balls
ever do to you?

482
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,055
They're dying
for a good cause, Watson.

483
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:23,691
Of course they are.
Ah!

484
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:26,644
Did you know

485
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:28,446
that when a bomb explodes,

486
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:31,098
the component that houses
the fuel is often atomized?

487
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,952
Now, this can make it difficult,
if not downright impossible,

488
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,788
to identify the device's
chemical composition.

489
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,207
The NYPD bomb squad
is currently struggling

490
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:41,409
with this very conundrum,
so I thought I would help.

491
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:43,828
With tennis balls?
I'm attempting to replicate

492
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,631
the odor and burn pattern
of the office bombing

493
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,917
using a few of my own
concoctions, and these balls

494
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,502
make the perfect
delivery mechanism.

495
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,466
When Edgar Knowles was
arrested this afternoon,

496
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:06,851
he confessed to setting off

497
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:10,321
five nitrate-based bombs
at various businesses.

498
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:12,240
No self-respecting eco-warrior

499
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:15,410
would use toxic, man-made
chemicals in his bombs.

500
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:18,246
He would use
natural ingredients.

501
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,498
Smells like fertilizer.

502
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,699
With good reason.

503
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,701
Beyond its horticultural
employments,

504
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:25,253
fertilizer can be
distilled down

505
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:28,423
and mixed into a rather potent
nitrate accelerant.

506
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,541
This ball is filled
with the stuff.

507
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:33,711
If Knowles did try
to blow up Vanowen S.C.,

508
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,097
he would have used nitrates,
and if he'd used nitrates,

509
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,049
the bomb would have filled
the air with an odor

510
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,884
as pungent
as it is distinctive,

511
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:41,853
the same odor that
you're smelling right now.

512
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:43,388
The thing is,
I didn't smell

513
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,106
any fertilizer
when we were there.

514
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,941
I smelled something else.

515
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:48,843
It was foreign to me
in the moment, but...

516
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:50,561
I have managed to recreate it
with the help of

517
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:52,680
my little
round friends here.

518
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:54,616
I am now certain
that the bomb was made

519
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:56,034
using potassium chlorate.

520
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:57,402
It's an accelerant made of

521
00:21:57,404 --> 00:21:59,370
gasoline, bleach
and petroleum jelly.

522
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:01,856
Are you saying that Edgar
Knowles was telling the truth

523
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,958
when he told you that
he didn't build the bomb

524
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,527
that exploded at Vanowen S.C.?

525
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:06,916
I am.

526
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,881
Well, if he didn't
build it, who did?

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,883
Haven't the foggiest.

528
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:34,652
Hey.

529
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,982
Heard you were
looking for me?

530
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:41,068
Yesterday, you gave us
Edgar Knowles on a silver platter.

531
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,070
Now you're telling me

532
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:45,439
he did every bomb
except for the one

533
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:47,190
from two days ago?
As I said before,

534
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:49,576
that bomb was built using
potassium chlorate.

535
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,862
Yeah, and Knowles only used
ones with cow manure.

536
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:53,413
I heard you.
That's not enough.

537
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,332
There's more.
I came in this morning

538
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,701
to reexamine the bomb's components,
and I pieced together

539
00:22:57,703 --> 00:22:59,286
some of the strips
of packing paper

540
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:00,837
that were used.
I managed to form

541
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,090
almost a third of a page
of the October 13 edition

542
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:04,491
of the New York Times.

543
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:06,593
This particular clump
caught my eye.

544
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,796
I saw small, almost
imperceptible indentations

545
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:11,765
along the upper fringe.

546
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:12,883
I don't see anything.

547
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:14,718
You wouldn't.

548
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,003
Well, most people
wouldn't, which is why

549
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:19,439
I traced over it.

550
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,359
The paper
that was used

551
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,278
in the bomb was
beneath another piece

552
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,946
of paper when
someone wrote that word.

553
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,731
They pressed hard enough
to make indentations.

554
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:29,066
Now, I already checked it

555
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:30,350
against Edgar Knowles's
handwriting.

556
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:31,351
It's not a match.

557
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:32,486
All due respect,
Holmes.

558
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:33,520
So what?

559
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,188
Maybe he had help with the bomb.

560
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,406
Maybe that person wrote some

561
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:38,191
weird note on top
of the newspaper.

562
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:40,577
As I said previously, I believe
Edgar Knowles worked alone.

563
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:42,663
And as I said previously,
I still like him

564
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:45,082
for the last bomb.

565
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:47,417
The threats against Vanowen
S.C. were never made public,

566
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:48,835
which means, aside
from the police,

567
00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:50,337
the firm's employees
were the only ones

568
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:51,638
who were aware of them.

569
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,206
I'd like you to
request a subpoena

570
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,508
of their personnel files

571
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,593
so that I can review them.
For what?

572
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:58,428
Well, imagine you were a
disgruntled employee, hmm?

573
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,981
You want to strike out at the
company, but you don't want

574
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,400
to get caught, so why not take
advantage of the ELM threats

575
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:04,935
to plant a device
of your own, hmm?

576
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:06,770
You get the blast,
they get the blame.

577
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:07,771
No.

578
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:08,772
No?

579
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:10,107
No subpoena.

580
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:11,942
If you really want
to go poking around

581
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:13,660
at Vanowen S.C.,
you're gonna have

582
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:14,945
to take it up with them.

583
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,415
Sorry I'm late.

584
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,905
I'm sure he's gonna
be here any second.

585
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:31,077
I really like those...

586
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,746
tattoos.

587
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,751
You know, I'm just gonna text
him again and see where he is.

588
00:24:47,295 --> 00:24:50,096
I'm really sorry, Alfredo,
but it doesn't look

589
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:52,599
like Sherlock is coming
and joining us today.

590
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,151
Be patient.

591
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:56,787
First rule
of good sponsorship.

592
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:59,289
Newcomers like him
don't always understand

593
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,774
the scope of the work involved.

594
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:03,043
They get frustrated.

595
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,944
We need to be patient
and methodical with him.

596
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:06,613
I was under the impression

597
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:08,632
that you'd never been
a sponsor before.

598
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:09,883
I haven't.

599
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,385
But I have a great one.

600
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,387
Taught me
everything he knows.

601
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:17,307
Truth is, I've been wanting
to be a sponsor for a while now.

602
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,459
People never ask.

603
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:21,678
Think it's because I'm quiet.

604
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,065
I can help your friend,
Miss Watson.

605
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,151
He just needs
to give me the chance.

606
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,480
Doing okay?

607
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:42,165
I am.

608
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,118
And thank you again for allowing
me to peruse these files.

609
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,487
Oh, it was
an easy decision to make.

610
00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:49,539
If you think there's
anyone here who has something

611
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:52,659
against this company,
I would like to know.

612
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:57,931
You're a fellow addict,
aren't you?

613
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,551
Crosswords.

614
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:02,969
You couldn't have
figured out those clues

615
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,522
at my computer
the other day if you weren't.

616
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:07,557
I dabble.

617
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,110
Well, I wish I could say
I just dabbled.

618
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:12,312
I used to have
my habit under control

619
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:14,948
back when the papers
only issued one a day.

620
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,117
Ever since they put
the last 50 years

621
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,653
of their archives online,
I'm a lost cause.

622
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:22,539
It's a miracle I get
any work done at all.

623
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,625
You want sex?

624
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:26,793
Excuse me?

625
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,862
I'm not averse,
Ms. Vanowen.

626
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:30,196
I'm just busy.

627
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,716
Perhaps we could set
an appointment.

628
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,718
You're flirting.

629
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,303
This crossword talk.

630
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:39,038
You find me attractive.

631
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,925
The feeling is
mutual, mostly.

632
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:43,710
The musculature
of your legs

633
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:46,096
and your shoulders suggests
a certain elasticity I find

634
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:48,548
quite tantalizing.

635
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,851
I must warn you, however,
a relationship between us

636
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:52,886
could never go
beyond the physical.

637
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:55,689
No offense to you, of course.

638
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:57,858
It's just... not my way.

639
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,559
Hey.

640
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:01,278
Am I interrupting?

641
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,863
Nope.

642
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:05,031
Not even a little.

643
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,672
Sorry I missed our
engagement, Watson.

644
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,341
As you can see,
I'm investigating

645
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,878
the possibility that a Vanowen
employee set the bomb.

646
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,447
It's okay-- I told Alfredo
I'd be in touch, and that

647
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,582
we could reschedule.

648
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:29,923
Is that the whole piece?
Uh...

649
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,141
Pradeep Singh.

650
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:34,261
Hired as a copywriter
in December 2003.

651
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:37,364
He was promoted to junior
associate in January 2007,

652
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,766
senior associate
in June 2007,

653
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:43,937
and finally associate
creative director in March 2008.

654
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:45,572
I see here that he
was written up

655
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:48,658
by the human resources
department on October 10, 2008

656
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,110
for engaging in a shouting match
with you, Mr. Wheeler.

657
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:52,712
I see the
human resources' report,

658
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,881
then nothing--
no more papers...

659
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,132
Yes, that's because
his contract

660
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,551
th this company
was terminated.

661
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,919
Because he fought with you?

662
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,387
Because he disappeared.

663
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:02,389
He came to work, left,
never came back.

664
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,558
It was in all the
papers at the time.

665
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,594
The police got involved,
never found him.

666
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,980
May I ask what sparked
the disagreement between

667
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:12,599
the two of you?

668
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:15,068
Uh... Pradeep wasn't happy.

669
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,021
He was a model employee
at the beginning,

670
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,522
but something changed him.

671
00:28:19,524 --> 00:28:21,691
He became-- I don't
know-- arrogant.

672
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:24,127
He started talking about
how he wanted more power

673
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,612
here at the company,
more control,

674
00:28:25,614 --> 00:28:27,247
and we gave it to him at first.

675
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,765
I mean, Pradeep was

676
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:30,166
a capable guy.

677
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:31,585
Then it all changed
when he came in asking

678
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,671
for his fourth raise
in 18 months.

679
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,656
Well...
You told him enough was enough?

680
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:38,375
No, that's when he snapped.

681
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:40,677
He told me
I'd be sorry.

682
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,379
And he worked here
for about another week,

683
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:43,663
and after that, he was gone.

684
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,849
Never saw
him again.

685
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,867
Pradeep is dead.

686
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:49,269
He died in 2008.

687
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,470
It was our understanding,

688
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:53,406
Mrs. Singh, that he
was never found,

689
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:54,941
alive or dead.

690
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:58,612
My husband loved me very much,
just as I loved him.

691
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:01,615
He never would run away.

692
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:04,067
I held out hope for him
for quite some time,

693
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:05,702
but eventually I had to accept

694
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,904
that the only
possible explanation

695
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:10,123
for his disappearance
was death.

696
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,559
You think he was
a victim of foul play.

697
00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:15,996
If he had collapsed somewhere,
had a heart attack or a stroke,

698
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:18,081
someone would have found him.

699
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,966
Pradeep was murdered.

700
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,535
Or he snapped-- planted
a bomb at his workplace,

701
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:24,421
and then dropped off the grid
before it detonated.

702
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:26,873
Do you have any idea
who might have wanted

703
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,174
to hurt your husband?

704
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,393
No.

705
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,013
There was the one man
at his office he argued with

706
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:34,764
a few days
before he vanished,

707
00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:36,716
but the police
were able to clear him.

708
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:39,085
Other than that,
he had no enemies.

709
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,687
He was a...
I'm just curious, Mrs. Singh.

710
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:42,956
Have you had any work done
in this room since 2008?

711
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,157
Work?
Remodeling,

712
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,576
refurbishment, reconstruction.

713
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:49,079
No, I haven't touched it
since Pradeep disappeared.

714
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:50,947
Not even to address the mold
on the wall behind that cabinet?

715
00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:53,249
How did you...

716
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,285
The nose knows.

717
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:58,038
Might we take a look
in your backyard?

718
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,339
Why?

719
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,524
Formality.

720
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:10,800
Actually, I think I'll just use
your facilities first.

721
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:12,602
I think I had a dodgy egg.

722
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,804
I'll join you presently.

723
00:30:37,778 --> 00:30:40,046
♪

724
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,795
It did.

725
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:14,080
It was nice to be
out in the country.

726
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:18,535
Would you excuse
us a moment?

727
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,787
Sure.
Excuse me.

728
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,591
Mrs. Singh was right--
her husband is dead.

729
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,326
He has been for
quite some time.

730
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:28,428
What are you talking about?
The photograph at the end

731
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,846
of the mantelpiece,
it shows Pradeep and Mrs. Singh

732
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,164
sitting on the sofa.
It was taken

733
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,766
in the same room
that we were sitting in.

734
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,551
I noticed several discrepancies
between the wall

735
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:37,070
in the photograph and the one
that we were facing.

736
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,889
The spacing between
the paintings was all wrong.

737
00:31:39,891 --> 00:31:41,307
In the photograph,

738
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:42,559
they were approximately
18 centimeters apart.

739
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:44,844
In the room, 12 centimeters.

740
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:47,197
There also hang lower now
by about ten centimeters.

741
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,648
Someone took
them all down,

742
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,033
put them
back up again,

743
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,184
didn't get the
measurements right.

744
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,735
So, Himali moved them?

745
00:31:52,737 --> 00:31:55,021
She says she hasn't had any work
done in that room,

746
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:56,873
and when I took the frames
off the wall,

747
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,192
I saw that she was right--
there's no old nail holes

748
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:00,994
that correspond to the frames'
original arrangement.

749
00:32:00,996 --> 00:32:03,362
There is, however,
a slight bulge.

750
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:04,714
Bulge?

751
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,416
The center
of the wall is almost

752
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:07,700
imperceptibly convex.

753
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:09,803
Why? Because the gasses released

754
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:11,537
from Pradeep Singh's
decomposing body

755
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,873
expanded the plastic sheeting
that he's wrapped in,

756
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,924
pushing outwards.

757
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:16,476
Wait a second.

758
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,812
Are you telling me that Pradeep
is in that wall?

759
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,513
That would explain
the mold, too.

760
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:23,099
No.
His killer removed insulation

761
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:24,400
to make space for his body.

762
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,269
This created
a temperature differential

763
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:28,605
between that section and the
others, condensation formed...

764
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:30,323
Then mold.
Mmm.

765
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,826
Four years ago,
Pradeep's murderer tore down

766
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:34,777
that section of wall,
stashed him inside,

767
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:37,030
and then replaced
and repainted the drywall.

768
00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:38,564
Are you sure?

769
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:40,917
I'm fairly sure.

770
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:55,089
Himali Singh didn't kill
her husband.

771
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,650
ICE confirms she was in Mumbai

772
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:59,135
visiting family during
most of October '08.

773
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:00,469
She didn't even come home

774
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:03,072
until she learned
Pradeep was missing.

775
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:04,324
Whoever murdered Pradeep
at home,

776
00:33:04,326 --> 00:33:06,493
they knew that
his wife was out of town.

777
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:09,145
Her trip would've provided
the privacy and time

778
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:10,947
to kill him
and stash him away.

779
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,532
Maybe Singh had a
coconspirator,

780
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:13,983
someone he built
the bomb with.

781
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:15,535
Things went south...
Mmm.

782
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,003
That's a reasonable
theory, Captain.

783
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:19,339
Problem is,
I no longer think

784
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:22,158
that Pradeep had anything
to do with it.

785
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,561
What's that--
company newsletter?

786
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:26,095
Now, that is
Pradeep's desk.

787
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:27,814
That is the air vent
in which the bomb

788
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:29,549
was concealed,
right next to him.

789
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:32,769
Now, if that had gone off
when it was supposed to in 2008,

790
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:34,170
it would have turned
him into so much

791
00:33:34,172 --> 00:33:35,889
newly promoted
hamburger.

792
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,691
Vanowen S.C.'s personnel files
showed that he did not miss

793
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:42,078
a single day's work until the
moment that he left for good.

794
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,613
That means he spent
almost a week

795
00:33:43,615 --> 00:33:45,865
in the early part
of October 2008

796
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,367
sitting within
spitting distance

797
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:48,985
of a live
explosive device.

798
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,404
You think it was
meant for him.

799
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:54,874
Well, it is abundantly clear
someone wanted Pradeep dead.

800
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:56,459
The question is,

801
00:33:56,461 --> 00:34:00,029
who would be willing to go
to such lengths and why?

802
00:34:00,031 --> 00:34:01,864
M.E. confirms
Pradeep Singh

803
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:03,532
was killed
by a gunshot wound

804
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:04,700
to the chest.

805
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:06,052
Death was followed
by, and I quote,

806
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:07,670
"pervasive
mummification""

807
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:09,889
That's everything we
found in his pockets.

808
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,891
It's kind of weird-- there's
a key on the key chain

809
00:34:11,893 --> 00:34:13,542
with a button to
unlock a car door,

810
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:16,379
but it's definitely
not a car key.

811
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:19,399
No, that is
a safety-deposit box key.

812
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:21,184
You can tell by the teeth.

813
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:29,409
S.L.B.

814
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:31,744
Sequoia Liberty Bank?

815
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:34,113
Box number 699.

816
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,487
Huh.

817
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,256
Cheech and Chong's
Next Movie?

818
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,874
Well, it's not a good movie,

819
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,594
but it didn't make me want
to commit a homicide.

820
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,047
Hmm, the movie is gone.

821
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,382
You see this slot here?

822
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:53,466
That's there to stop you

823
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,934
from recording
over the tape.

824
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:57,220
You put Scotch tape there,
it allows you to do so.

825
00:34:57,222 --> 00:35:01,140
Now all we got to do is
find a VCR... in 2012.

826
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,142
Have you not been to my home
yet, Detective Bell?

827
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,395
I maintain several VCRs.

828
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:09,866
I like to watch
police interrogations

829
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:11,600
from the '70s and '80s.

830
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:14,370
Techniques were rawer
back then, and, uh, you do,

831
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,456
on occasion, learn
something useful.

832
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,874
Oh.

833
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,626
This is one of my CIs;
I've been waiting

834
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:20,994
to hear from him
on another case.

835
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,312
You mind if I take this
in private?

836
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:24,080
My parlor is at your disposal.

837
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:26,165
What up, Carlo?

838
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,967
Mm-hmm.

839
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:32,288
So, listen, I texted Alfredo,
and we're all set for tomorrow.

840
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,140
Coffee at 9:00.

841
00:35:34,142 --> 00:35:37,393
Alfredo, yeah, uh, I don't think
that's going to work out.

842
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:39,128
Spark's no longer there.

843
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,898
I think I'm going to have
to seek sponsorship elsewhere.

844
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,067
What are you talking about?
You hand-picked him.

845
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:46,402
Hmm, we can do better.

846
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,607
Is this about us?

847
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,493
Is what about us?
Your reluctance to find a sponsor.

848
00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:55,495
I'm starting to think
you're being difficult

849
00:35:55,497 --> 00:35:57,163
because you don't want me
to leave.

850
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:58,665
You never told me
you were funny.

851
00:35:58,667 --> 00:35:59,782
You picked Alfredo
because you thought

852
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,484
I wasn't gonna like him,

853
00:36:01,486 --> 00:36:03,419
but now that I do, you're trying
to push him away, too.

854
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,121
Okay, what you're
feeling right now--

855
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,789
I've seen
it before.

856
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,091
Clients start
to worry about what

857
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:09,592
their lives
are going to be like

858
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,960
after their
companion leaves.

859
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:12,845
They kind of get a
separation anxiety.

860
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,430
It's pretty standard, actually.

861
00:36:14,432 --> 00:36:16,265
I guess, since you've never
been anything

862
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:18,184
but opposed to me
being here, it...

863
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:21,771
it never occurred to me
that you might feel it, too.

864
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,439
I don't know what you're on,

865
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:25,525
but old me would definitely
have wanted some.

866
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:27,977
Listen, I am...
You're back. Excellent.

867
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:44,527
Hey, is that Pradeep?

868
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:45,878
He looks about...

869
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,063
25 years old there.

870
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:48,698
Hey, sweetie.

871
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,433
I'm so glad we finally
got to have this date.

872
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:52,185
Me, too.
You ready to party?

873
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,970
Yes.
She's a prostitute.

874
00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:55,738
That's interesting.

875
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,640
High-end, by
the looks of it.

876
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:04,063
You want to help me with this?
Sure.

877
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:09,852
Hello, Ms. Vanowen.

878
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,060
Well, we can keep watching
if you'd both like,

879
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:20,696
but I'd say we've
found our bomber.

880
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,505
All this just so you can
ask me a few questions?

881
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:33,459
Just a consent form, ma'am.
Standard procedure.

882
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:37,096
So, now you want to tell me
what this is all about?

883
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:40,583
Hey, sweetie. I'm so glad we
finally got to have this date.

884
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:41,968
Me, too.
Ready to party?

885
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,419
Yes.
Good.

886
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:45,754
I'm sorry. Was that
supposed to be me?

887
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:47,523
I've learned
since we spoke

888
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:50,026
that you come from
modest origins.

889
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:52,728
Father a contractor,
mother a homemaker.

890
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,097
So, when you got
into business school,

891
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:56,415
you needed
a source of income.

892
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,117
Something to pay
your tuition

893
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,287
and provide you with
seed money for your company.

894
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:03,706
You turned,
in your hour of need,

895
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,958
to the world's
oldest profession.

896
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,495
Took to it with
some gusto, I'd say.

897
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:12,882
Okay, let's turn this off.

898
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:16,135
You built a successful
new life for yourself

899
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:19,639
on the ashes of your old one,
and no one was any the wiser.

900
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:24,260
Until Pradeep Singh
got a job at Vanowen.

901
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:26,262
It probably took him
a while to realize

902
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:28,314
that his new boss
was one of the women

903
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:30,349
that he had secretly
recorded years ago,

904
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:33,436
but when he did,
he turned the screw.

905
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:35,605
So to speak.

906
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,740
Mmm. Three promotions in a year?

907
00:38:37,742 --> 00:38:39,808
That smells like a payoff to me.

908
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,529
No. I promoted Pradeep
because he deserved it.

909
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:47,033
Small confession:

910
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,318
I find the anti-
prostitution laws

911
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,986
in this country
rather Victorian.

912
00:38:50,988 --> 00:38:52,505
Sex is a commodity.

913
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:54,707
Why shouldn't there
be a market for it?

914
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:57,627
But, of course,
not everyone thinks like I do.

915
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,495
Which is why

916
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:01,664
you had to pay Pradeep
until his demands

917
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,833
escalated past the point
that you could meet them.

918
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:08,137
Then you cast about
for a way to kill him.

919
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:12,841
Now, you already had threatening
letters from the ELM.

920
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:15,678
So you built a pipe bomb,
planning to blame them.

921
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,063
But when it didn't detonate,

922
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:19,732
you simply shot Pradeep
and walled him off.

923
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,450
I imagine it was your father

924
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:23,819
who taught you
how to hang drywall.

925
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:28,558
That's very creative,
I'll give you that much.

926
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,494
Can he just sling mud at me
like this?

927
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,829
You can seek counsel
at any time, ma'am.

928
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,381
Hardly surprising
that you were the one

929
00:39:35,383 --> 00:39:37,700
to lead the search for new
offices for Vanowen S.C.

930
00:39:37,702 --> 00:39:39,201
You were, after all,
the only person who knew

931
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:40,419
that there was an
unexploded bomb in the wall.

932
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,338
You know what?

933
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,424
I think I will
actually call my lawyer.

934
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:46,759
Well, if you do,
Ms. Vanowen,

935
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,144
you might want
to tell him

936
00:39:48,146 --> 00:39:49,979
you're about
to be arrested.

937
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:54,216
You have an old videotape
and some stupid theories.

938
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:55,401
This is not evidence.

939
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:56,986
Yes, well,
I found something

940
00:39:56,988 --> 00:39:58,688
on one of the
scraps of paper

941
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,156
that was used to
pack the bomb.

942
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:02,057
An imprint of the
word "Novocain""

943
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:03,910
Useful handwriting sample,

944
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:06,028
but the message itself,
rather opaque.

945
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:09,115
Until one considers your love
of crosswords. Novocain.

946
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:11,066
The answer to 144 across

947
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:13,235
from the New York Times
crossword,

948
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:14,837
October 13, 2008.

949
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:17,373
The clue was "pain's enemy""
in case you forgot.

950
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,592
Now, Detective Bell and the
Questioned Documents Unit

951
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:22,027
have just matched it to a
handwriting sample you gave us

952
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:24,177
when you signed
your consent form.

953
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:28,851
Mmm. Detective Bell,
the honor is all yours.

954
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:31,971
Ms. Vanowen, would you
face that way, please?

955
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,524
You are under arrest
for the bombing

956
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:38,144
that took the lives
of David Preston and Roy Smalls.

957
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,904
This is a surprise.

958
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,656
I was on my way over
to show you something,

959
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:51,958
then I got your message.

960
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,627
Yeah, well... nothing personal.

961
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:57,046
I don't take it
personal. It's okay.

962
00:40:57,048 --> 00:40:58,798
But since I'm here...

963
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,868
Ever since I got
straightened out,

964
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,953
I've been picking up
work with car companies.

965
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:06,622
I test their
security systems.

966
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:09,124
I guess they figure anything
that can keep me out

967
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:10,977
is good enough for
their customers.

968
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,729
My last job just came in.

969
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:15,898
Miss Watson tells me that
you're into lock-picking.

970
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,184
I figure maybe you
want to give it a shot.

971
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:19,852
Well, the truth is, Alfredo,

972
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:22,321
I'm already quite adept
at defeating security systems.

973
00:41:22,323 --> 00:41:24,807
This stuff's not even
on the market yet.

974
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:26,442
So, really...

975
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,661
how would you know
if you could beat it?

976
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:39,088
You know
you want to try.

977
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,956
Obviously your idea.

978
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,009
Zeroing in on
common ground.

979
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:45,428
Hoping it's enough
to make me reconsider him.

980
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,162
It won't be.

981
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:50,299
What's the harm in getting
to know the guy?

982
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:53,569
One way or the other,

983
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:56,105
I'm gonna be out
of your life in a few weeks.

984
00:41:57,024 --> 00:41:58,841
Maybe you're
dreading that day;

985
00:41:58,843 --> 00:42:01,544
maybe you're counting
the seconds.

986
00:42:01,546 --> 00:42:03,846
Either way,
I'm going to make sure

987
00:42:03,848 --> 00:42:07,033
you're ready
when the time comes.

988
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,451
I promise.

989
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,190
If I help him
with his assignment,

990
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:17,743
it does not mean I am assenting
to his sponsorship.

991
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:18,911
Of course it doesn't.

992
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:20,880
I am quite self-sufficient.

993
00:42:20,882 --> 00:42:23,049
Of course you are.

994
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:40,113
Factory-installed
immobilizer

995
00:42:40,115 --> 00:42:42,281
or after-market
tracking system?

996
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:44,233
Not telling.

997
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:47,853
That's quite all right.

998
00:42:47,855 --> 00:42:51,357
I'll just figure it out
for myself.

999
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:54,432
I'm entirely
self-sufficient, you know.
