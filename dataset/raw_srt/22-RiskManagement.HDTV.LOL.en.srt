ANNOUNCER: Previously on Elementary:
Several weeks ago,

2
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:07,034
he learned of the existence

3
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:08,685
of a woman named Irene Adler.

4
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:10,855
He's only loved
one person in his life,

5
00:00:10,857 --> 00:00:12,740
as far as I can tell,
and she was murdered.

6
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:15,493
Your girl, that was him.

7
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:18,245
That was Moriarty.

8
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:20,214
And whom do I have the
pleasure of speaking to?

9
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:22,249
My name is Moriarty.

10
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:25,920
I believe we're overdue
for a chat.

11
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:29,723
Well, if this is Moriarty,
then, yeah, long overdue.

12
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,342
If?

13
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,210
You're just a voice on
the end of a telephone.

14
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:35,262
I don't even know if
you have a first name.

15
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:37,064
Mind telling me
your first name?

16
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:38,849
I appreciate your

17
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,219
passing my message along
to Sebastian Moran.

18
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,888
I hear his prognosis
is quite grave.

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,073
So what?

20
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:47,858
I expect you to feel angry

21
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,560
because I manipulated you.

22
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:51,612
Rather easily, I might add.

23
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:53,163
Chin up, Holmes.

24
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:54,865
Manipulation is my business.

25
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:57,568
Seems more like murder
is your business.

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,037
A part of it.

27
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,089
Explain.

28
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:04,091
Consider me a spider.

29
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,793
I sit motionless

30
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,478
at the center of my web.

31
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,079
That web has
a thousand radiatis,

32
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,849
and I know well every
quiver of each of them.

33
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,351
I do little myself,
I only plan.

34
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:18,255
But my agents are numerous
and splendidly organized.

35
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:19,974
If there is a crime to be done,

36
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,226
a paper to be abstracted,
a house to be rifled,

37
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:25,563
a man to be removed,
the word is passed to me,

38
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:26,614
the matter is planned

39
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:28,666
and carried out.

40
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:32,319
So, you're a pimp, and
assassins are your girls.

41
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:34,605
Yes, I suppose that's

42
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,407
one way of putting it.

43
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,442
Irene Adler.

44
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:40,944
Did you have her killed?

45
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:43,497
That is the question, is it not?

46
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,966
The one that's haunted you
these many months?

47
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,217
Why'd you do it?

48
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,286
And what is your interest in me?

49
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:51,305
You want answers.

50
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:53,240
I don't blame you.

51
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:55,626
But first, I require
something of you.

52
00:01:55,628 --> 00:01:56,844
I'd like to hire you.

53
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:59,480
Not as an assassin,

54
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:01,865
though I do believe you'd excel
in that position.

55
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:05,586
I'd like to secure your services
as an investigator.

56
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:07,888
A man named Wallace Rourke

57
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,740
was murdered in Brooklyn
several months ago.

58
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:12,693
The New York Police
Department investigated,

59
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:14,862
but failed to find any leads.

60
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:17,298
Bring his killer to justice,
and I promise

61
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,401
I'll give you all the answers
you can handle.

New York Ledger

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,756
Wallace Rourke,
mechanic, age 43,

68
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,308
found stabbed to death
in an alley in Brooklyn.

69
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,077
Can we just take a moment
to talk about

70
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,578
what just happened?
Mr. Rourke's missing wallet

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,813
and watch led
the police to suspect

72
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,181
he was the victim of a mugger.

73
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,650
Moriarty, or someone
claiming to be Moriarty,

74
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,019
called and asked you to take
a case, and you're doing it.

75
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,471
And why wouldn't I?
For one thing, he's dangerous.

76
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,307
For another, you think
he's behind Irene's death.

77
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:14,142
Yes, and in the course
of one brief exchange,

78
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:15,476
I've already gleaned
that Moriarty

79
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,362
is between 40 and 45
years of age,

80
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,697
he hails from Sussex,
and he has some interest

81
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,900
or connection
to Mr. Wallace Rourke.

82
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,117
As the case continues,

83
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,202
there will be more interactions.

84
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,236
And with each interaction,

85
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,205
more of the man
will be revealed to me.

86
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,740
Assuming the man on the phone
is actually is Moriarty.

87
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,024
Even if it is a mere minion,

88
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:31,543
just identifying
the minion will get me

89
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,194
one step closer
to identifying the man himself.

90
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,412
How do you know
it's not a trap?

91
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,464
How do you know he doesn't
want to kill you?

92
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,799
He doesn't.
How can you be so sure?

93
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,167
Because three years ago,
he ordered

94
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,202
Daniel Gottlieb
not to kill me.

95
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:43,671
Last night, I was in the sights
of another assassin's rifle.

96
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,256
Yet, here I sit.

97
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,558
It couldn't be clearer--
he doesn't want me dead.

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,809
Then what does he want?

99
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,345
That's precisely
what I intend to find out.

100
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,566
So...

101
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,184
as we already know,

102
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,518
Wallace Rourke was attacked

103
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,820
by an unknown assailant.

104
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,221
His watch, wallet
and cell phone were taken.

105
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,356
He bled to death
in an alleyway...

106
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:03,107
He was married.

107
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,260
Perhaps a condolence call
to his widow is in order.

108
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,580
Captain Gregson wants a word
with you.

109
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,781
Can it wait?

110
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,250
Not you.
Miss Watson.

111
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,619
Hi. You wanted to see me?

112
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,070
Oh, yeah. Oh, come in.

113
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,705
Sit down. Close the door.

114
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:19,173
You ever have trouble trying

115
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,759
to remember
your online passwords?

116
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,761
Sure. Sometimes. Why?

117
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,579
I got this friend named Eddie.

118
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:27,682
We grew up together.

119
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,134
He invented a widget
for storing all your passwords

120
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,687
for your computer
into one place.

121
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,555
You know the one?
Yeah.

122
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:37,091
He made a fortune,
sold his company,

123
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,943
and he moves his family

124
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,195
down to Boca Raton.
Good for Eddie.

125
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,448
Yeah, but not so good
for his daughter, Kelly.

126
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,300
She ended up with
a pretty serious drug problem.

127
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,651
I'm sorry to hear that.

128
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,986
So Eddie and I were

129
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,787
talking on the phone
the other day.

130
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,373
And he happened to mention that
he and his wife were looking

131
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,125
to hook Kelly up
with a sober companion

132
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,127
after she gets out.
I'm thinking,

133
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,162
I know a great one.

134
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,065
You know that I don't
do kind of work anymore.

135
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,468
Probably only take you
a coup of months.

136
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,887
It's not like you're formally
committed to Holmes anymore.

137
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,472
Right?
Hmm. Speaking of. Oh.

138
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,390
He's already downstairs.
I should go meet him.

139
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,293
But you know what?
I will give you some other names.

140
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,764
I'm sorry, I've never heard

141
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:18,483
the name "Moriarty"
before in my life.

142
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,118
Does your husband
do any business

143
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,602
with any British people?

144
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,971
Wallace worked in a garage.

145
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:27,075
I mean, he knew a couple
of Dominican guys.

146
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,110
When the police questioned you,
you mentioned something

147
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:31,284
about Wallace thinking that
he was being followed.

148
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,281
Yeah.

149
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,148
A few weeks, um, before he died,

150
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,583
he kept seeing the same car

151
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,418
in his rearview mirror,
but it just...

152
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,454
it happened the one time,
so the cops said

153
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:40,955
it didn't have anything
to do with the mugging.

154
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:42,523
Are those some
of your husband's things?

155
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:45,093
Uh, yeah.

156
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,661
Wallace was kind of a packrat.

157
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,564
Do you mind if we take a look?

158
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,383
Yeah.

159
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,803
So, you said

160
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,972
you're consulting
detectives, right?

161
00:05:57,974 --> 00:05:59,607
Not the real kind?

162
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,610
Oh, I assure you, the work
that we do is quite real.

163
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,645
So, does that mean
there's a new lead?

164
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,447
Not exactly,
but sometimes,

165
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,701
new eyes on a case can be just
as useful as new information.

166
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,536
As a matter of fact,

167
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,686
it might be quite useful

168
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,572
to spend a bit more time
with his belongings.

169
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,023
Perhaps we could borrow them
for a few days.

170
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,959
Sure.

171
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,328
Uh, fine, yeah.
Take whatever.

172
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,879
Thanks.

173
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,917
Um, I thought I read
in the police report

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,169
that the mugger also stole
your husband's phone.

175
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:29,887
Yeah, well,
like I said--

176
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,806
Wallace is a packrat.

177
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,707
He never threw anything out.

178
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,209
That's his old phone.

179
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,561
A few weeks before he died,

180
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,263
someone bumped
into him on the street

181
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,815
and spilled coffee all over it.

182
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,551
He had his new one
on him when he died.

183
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:48,222
Please... please...
find whoever did this.

184
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,908
According to Wallace's
financial records,

185
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,944
him and his wife were living
quite close to the bone.

186
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,579
Is that significant?

187
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,564
Moriarty paid
Sebastian Moran

188
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,567
and Daniel Gottlieb
quite handsomely.

189
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,004
Oh, so, you think Rourke
was working for him, too?

190
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,590
Moran and Gottlieb
were assassins.

191
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,009
Perhaps he did something
less dangerous.

192
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,294
Perhaps he was just good
at hiding his money.

193
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,880
Maybe, but why
would Moriarty want

194
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,715
to expose another
one of his employees?

195
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,684
It seems a little
risky, doesn't it?

196
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,386
It's one of the advantages

197
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,221
of being a shadowy
criminal mastermind, I imagine.

198
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,773
You get to take
the occasional risk.

199
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,691
But I see your point.

200
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,311
According to the M.E.'s report,
Rourke's initial wounds

201
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,980
were these two stabs
to the chest.

202
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,782
The wounds are smooth,
not jagged,

203
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,984
which would seem to
suggest that he was

204
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,119
not moving or struggling

205
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,537
when he was stabbed.

206
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,872
You're saying
he didn't resist?

207
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,907
I'm saying he was motionless

208
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,109
or maybe he was frozen in fear.

209
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,162
Wallace was
a former Army Ranger.

210
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,914
Given his combat experience,
that doesn't seem likely.

211
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,135
See this bruise
below his left ear?

212
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,753
That's from a blow
to the mastoid process.

213
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,339
That's designed to stun.

214
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,842
He wasn't frozen in fear;
he was immobilized.

215
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,977
Then the killer stabbed him
in each lung,

216
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,846
silencing him for good.

217
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,964
Whoever attacked Wallace
wanted him dead,

218
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,566
and knew how to do it.

219
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,652
This is not the work of
your average street thug

220
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,103
looking for a wallet, no.

221
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:10,855
Moriarty's right.

222
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,058
Obviously, there's more to
this than meets the eye.

223
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,195
And now...

224
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,948
I require sustenance.

225
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,494
Out with it, Watson,
or you're gonna spend

226
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,796
all night
almost asking me something.

227
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:38,716
What was she like?

228
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,687
Irene, you-you talk
about what happened to her,

229
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,223
but you never talk
about who she was.

230
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,191
She was difficult to explain.

231
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,644
And I mean that as a compliment.

232
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:51,345
She was American.

233
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,397
Really?

234
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,566
I held it against her
only briefly.

235
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,986
She was
an exquisite painter.

236
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:02,490
She made her living
restoring Renaissance paintings

237
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,525
for art museums.

238
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:07,712
She traveled extensively
because of her work.

239
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,549
She was highly intelligent,

240
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,052
optimistic
about the human condition.

241
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,171
You mean that
as a compliment, too?

242
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:19,140
I do, oddly enough.

243
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,893
I usually consider it
a sign of stupidity,

244
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,978
but with Irene, it seemed...

245
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,596
almost convincing.

246
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,548
She was,

247
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,351
to me, the woman.

248
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:32,403
To me, she eclipsed
and predominated

249
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,773
all of her gender.

250
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,360
She's the one I ever, um...

251
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,912
And the sex...

252
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,496
You-you don't have to...

253
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,081
I learned things, Watson-- me.

254
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,534
And that hasn't happened before.

255
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,870
What is it?

256
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,905
I think Wallace Rourke
might have been right

257
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,474
about being followed.

258
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,793
Have a look at that.

259
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,079
It's an old shipping label.

260
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,716
For the cell phone he had on him
when he died.

261
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:02,967
Look at the return address.

262
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,770
Uh, "Postal Unlimited.

263
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,755
2249 Lexington Avenue""

264
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:09,607
All the major
cellular companies ship

265
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,092
from distribution warehouses
upstate.

266
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:13,778
And how does that equal
him being followed?

267
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,529
Because the simplest way
to follow someone in this day

268
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,431
and age is to track them
via their cell phone.

269
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,749
It's a relatively
simple undertaking

270
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,051
if you have the device's

271
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,902
electronic
identification number.

272
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,371
Which you would have

273
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,622
if you'd supplied
the replacement cell.

274
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,741
So who sent Rourke
his new phone?

275
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,494
You learning anything?

276
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,580
Apparently, if my gut
tells me I'm in danger,

277
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:33,998
I probably am.

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,133
Profound stuff here.

279
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,636
Guy runs one of the biggest
private security firms

280
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,454
in the country;
he's got to know something.

281
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,122
Mr. Holmes, Miss Watson.

282
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,791
Hi.

283
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,259
I'm Daren Sutter.

284
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:46,761
This is my wife Kate.

285
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,347
We were told you consult
for the NYPD.

286
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,598
We have a few
questions.

287
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,066
If it's all the
same with you,

288
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,818
we'd like to ask
them in private.

289
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:59,690
Hmm, so you're a third-degree
black belt in Kyokushinkai.

290
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,158
That's impressive.

291
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,244
Yeah, only took me 20 years
of study to pull it off.

292
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,946
Do you practice the,
uh, martial arts?

293
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:09,000
A bit of single-stick
now and again.

294
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,585
How can we help you?

295
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,338
This is Wallace Rourke.

296
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,840
Your firm was tracking him.

297
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,041
We'd like to know why.

298
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,009
Oh.

299
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,993
No?

300
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,629
No, I'm afraid
we don't recognize him.

301
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,664
Several months ago,
you or one of your employees

302
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,433
ran into Mr. Rourke
and made sure

303
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,469
that his cell phone met its end
via a cup of French Roast.

304
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,304
He ordered another cell
phone from his provider

305
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,305
but, according to them,

306
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,857
never switched it on,

307
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,525
most probably because
it was intercepted en route

308
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,894
by you or another one
of your employees.

309
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,563
Instead, unbeknownst
to Mr. Rourke, he received

310
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,649
and began to use
an identical cell phone

311
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,651
supplied by your company.

312
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,821
We found the shipping label
for that in Rourke's things.

313
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:49,022
The return address is
for a shipping store

314
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:50,491
right around the
corner from here.

315
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,576
A helpful gentleman
identified your company

316
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,628
as the one who paid
to have it sent.

317
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,363
Once Rourke activated
your phone,

318
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:58,031
you were able to monitor
his every move,

319
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,534
and we believe that you did,
right up until the moment

320
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:04,171
he was stabbed to death
three months ago in Brooklyn.

321
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,374
Actually we only surveilled
Rourke for a couple of days.

322
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,591
Daren...

323
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,343
Well, investigative
work like this

324
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,562
merits at least some kind
of an answer; it's not

325
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,148
as if we can keep denying
any knowledge of Rourke.

326
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,183
Right?

327
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,401
You understand
we're not admitting

328
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,652
to tracking his phone.

329
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,321
No, no, that would be illegal.

330
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,573
We looked into
Mr. Rourke based on threats

331
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,159
he allegedly made
against a client.

332
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,194
After a brief period
of legal surveillance,

333
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,413
we realized the claims
were unfounded;

334
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,781
we stopped the surveillance.

335
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,199
Who was this client?

336
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,085
I'm afraid
that's confidential.

337
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:40,207
Let me guess: the client who
hired Sutter Risk Management

338
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,343
to investigate
Wallace Rourke is

339
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,744
our new suspect
in his murder.

340
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,846
Now all we have to do
is figure out his name.

341
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,964
Already have.

342
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,583
First name "Made""
second name "Up""

343
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,185
I don't believe he exists.
Why not?

344
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,586
Because I believe
we've already met

345
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:54,054
Wallace Rourke's murderer,

346
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,273
and he's the spitting
image of this man.

347
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,451
Daren Sutter's book

348
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,135
amounts to a
virtual confession

349
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:08,129
to the murder of
Wallace Rourke.

350
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,148
He published that book
five years ago.

351
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,866
How'd he confess to something
he hadn't done yet?

352
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,218
The book is more than

353
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,286
a mass market précis
of his insights

354
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:17,038
into security and
risk management.

355
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,224
It is a window into what
drew him to the field

356
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:20,541
in the first place.

357
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:22,894
Look at page 13.

358
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:26,064
February, 1991,
Westport, Connecticut--

359
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,732
Sutter was 23.

360
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,050
His older sister Leah was

361
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:30,018
brutally murdered during

362
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,769
what the police believe was

363
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,238
a home invasion robbery.

364
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,857
Sutter was staying with her
at the time.

365
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,458
Oh, he got home just as the
perpetrator fled the house.

366
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,610
More than that.

367
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:40,328
He came face-to-face
with the man.

368
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,581
He gave the police
a full description.

369
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,900
Enough for them to generate...

370
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:49,754
a detailed sketch.

371
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,157
So you think Wallace Rourke is

372
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,211
the one who killed
Sutter's sister 22 years ago.

373
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,712
The police never
caught the culprit.

374
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:00,381
Sutter was tormented
by his failure

375
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:02,717
to protect her and law
enforcement's failure

376
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:05,553
to catch killer-- it
became his raison d'étre.

377
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:06,754
He dropped out of
business school.

378
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,022
He began to study
law enforcement,

379
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,808
security... and
Kyokushinkai karate,

380
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,261
which utilizes
mastoid strikes.

381
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:16,648
Just like the blow used
to stun Wallace Rourke

382
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,815
before he was stabbed to death.

383
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,600
Now all you really
know is that

384
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:22,320
Wallace Rourke has
a passing resemblance

385
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:23,988
to an old police sketch.

386
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,407
Did he have
a criminal history?

387
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,293
According to his Army record,
he enlisted under a waiver,

388
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,278
which means a judge
gave him the choice

389
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,213
between prison or the Army.

390
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:34,966
His conviction was for
breaking and entering.

391
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,617
Can we place Rourke
anywhere near the murder?

392
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,454
Following his discharge from
the Army in November 1990,

393
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:42,257
Rourke moved back to
his mother's house

394
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,426
in Stamford, Connecticut,
which I believe

395
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,428
is half an hour's drive
from where Leah was killed.

396
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,897
So it is possible that,
over 20 years ago,

397
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,516
Wallace Rourke killed
Sutter's sister.

398
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,901
And that Rourke's recent death
was the result

399
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:57,805
of Sutter tracking him down
and killing him in retribution.

400
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:00,325
But why does Moriarty care
about any of this?

401
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:03,111
I would venture he wants us
to bring down Sutter.

402
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,980
Sutter's security firm,
as you yourself pointed out,

403
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:07,665
is one of the best
in the country.

404
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,117
With Sutter removed, it would

405
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,818
in theory, make his
clients more vulnerable.

406
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,087
Moriarty may have one of
them in his crosshairs.

407
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:14,172
Which means our work
on this case

408
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,823
could cost someone
their life.

409
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:18,543
Not if our work leads to
Moriarty's undoing first.

410
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,962
Which will mean we save that
person and anyone else

411
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:22,797
Moriarty intends to
victimize in the future.

412
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,799
Okay, let's say you're right--
Moriarty planned this.

413
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,050
That would mean he already knew

414
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,935
that Sutter killed
Wallace Rourke.

415
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:29,437
Which is why I've arranged
to speak with Sutter

416
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:31,055
first thing in the
morning in private.

417
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:33,775
"In private"?

418
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:35,393
It's gonna be a very
delicate conversation.

419
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:36,611
For what it's worth,

420
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:38,229
he's not bringing
his wife either.

421
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,293
Mr. Sutter, thank you
for meeting me.

422
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:54,495
Stand up, please.

423
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,367
Okay...

424
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,719
Can you tell me what
you're doing there?

425
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:02,720
It's a bug-sweeper.

426
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,838
I'm checking
for listening devices.

427
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,259
Okay.

428
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,011
Right.

429
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:13,714
Okay.

430
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,717
Thank you. Your turn.

431
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,519
When you've heard
what I have to say,

432
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,904
you'll want to be quite sure

433
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:21,722
we're not being recorded.

434
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:28,029
Excellent, good.

435
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:31,416
Now then, I'm curious.

436
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:34,402
How do you feel since
you killed Wallace Rourke?

437
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:36,087
Okay, we're done.
No, no, listen to me.

438
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,091
Consider it an inquiry from
one scarred man to another.

439
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,876
Or rather from one man to one

440
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:45,246
whose wounds have
finally begun to heal.

441
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:46,597
I can tell the change from
the pictures in your office.

442
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:48,299
Since December
you've lost 15 pounds,

443
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:50,852
you got rid of the bags
under your eyes.

444
00:16:50,854 --> 00:16:53,087
Both signs
of a lifting depression.

445
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,524
Avenging your sister's death
has... has freed you.

446
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,059
I told you--
we surveilled Rourke

447
00:16:58,061 --> 00:16:59,427
for a couple of days;
that's it.

448
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:00,561
You're a terrible liar.

449
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:01,729
Actually, I'm an
excellent liar.

450
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:02,930
No, no, no--
better than most

451
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:04,899
and excellent are
two different things.

452
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,435
I know that you killed Rourke.

453
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:09,554
If you had proof, you'd be
talking to the police, right?

454
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:11,172
I don't have
any proof yet.

455
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:13,124
It's just a matter of time.

456
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:15,293
Unless we can find some way

457
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:18,329
to divert my attention.

458
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:20,748
Moriarty.

459
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,216
Does the name mean
anything to you?

460
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:24,001
Should it?

461
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,386
Yes, it should.

462
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:27,505
He pointed me
in your direction.

463
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:30,258
I think he wishes to profit
from your incarceration.

464
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,726
I'm just not sure how.

465
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:34,145
I've never heard that name
before in my life.

466
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:37,098
Now you're telling the truth.

467
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,233
Okay, I'm gonna need access
to your client files.

468
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:40,468
See if I can discern
if there's a link

469
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,019
between him and one of them.

470
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:44,188
You want me to trust
you with my business

471
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,441
based on some crazy story
about a mystery man

472
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:47,658
plotting my demise?

473
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,993
No.

474
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:51,312
Some proof then.

475
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:54,031
Judging by the precision
with which you killed Rourke,

476
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,617
not to mention
Moriarty's resources,

477
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,819
I wouldn't be surprised if he
learned of your transgression

478
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:01,372
via listening device
in your office and/or home.

479
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,624
Impossible-- we sweep
both regularly.

480
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:05,843
"Regularly"-- so if one
knew the schedule,

481
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:08,679
then one could remove
and replace bugs as needed.

482
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,998
So, sweep them today,
see what you find,

483
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,050
then contact me and we'll talk
about your clients.

484
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,475
Are you trying to
get rid of me?

485
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,477
What're...?

486
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,844
What are you talking about?

487
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:25,146
Well, your friend in Boca,

488
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,148
the one whose daughter
needs a companion,

489
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,349
I-I just feel like
you're pushing me

490
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,450
to take that offer.

491
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,785
Are you unhappy with my work?

492
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:33,187
No, of course not.

493
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:35,706
I appreciate the work
you've done with Holmes.

494
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,909
And, uh, you're
turning into a...

495
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:41,195
pretty damn good investigator
in your own right.

496
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,696
But...?

497
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:46,167
Have a seat.

498
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:52,206
There's something you got
to try to understand.

499
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,426
Guys like him,

500
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:57,345
they walk between the raindrops.

501
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:58,479
They don't get wet.

502
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:00,064
People like you do.

503
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,767
People like
his ex-girlfriend do.

504
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:05,102
So you're concerned
about my safety.

505
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:07,238
In case you haven't noticed,

506
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,057
a lot of bodies been dropping
around our boy of late.

507
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,993
You're in the danger zone, also.

508
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,245
I've been a cop for 30 years.

509
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:15,396
I carry a gun.

510
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,365
And a penis.

511
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,283
You think this is
about you being a woman?

512
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,168
I'm just don't understand
why you are concerned

513
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,087
about my safety specifically.

514
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:26,290
No one, and I mean no one,
is closer to this guy

515
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:29,243
than you are-- you live in
his house, for crying out loud.

516
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:30,578
He needs me right now.

517
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,265
That guy is always
gonna need someone.

518
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:37,768
He may be the smartest guy
I've ever met in my life.

519
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,688
But he is also
the most self-absorbed.

520
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,774
He probably doesn't
even recognize

521
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,643
the danger you're in.

522
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:47,361
I do.

523
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,484
Captain...sorry to interrupt,
but there's a Daren Sutter here

524
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:55,536
from Sutter Risk Management.

525
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:57,779
Says he wants to confess
to the murder of Wallace Rourke.

526
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,442
Uh, I came across Wallace Rourke

527
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:03,544
after a routine
background check.

528
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:05,129
He was a mechanic.

529
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:08,249
He applied for a position
at a high-end dealership.

530
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:11,802
My company was responsible for
reviewing the three finalists.

531
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:14,472
And how did you know he was
the man who killed your sister?

532
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,390
I recognized him
immediately.

533
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:18,792
It's been 22 years since
Leah was murdered,

534
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:21,479
and I still remember
everything about that night.

535
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,514
Especially him.

536
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,316
Okay...

537
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:26,467
why don't we start
at the beginning?

538
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:27,985
He found them.

539
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,137
Moriarty's bugs.

540
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,857
You think that's how Moriarty
knew he killed Rourke?

541
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:34,909
He knows that someone can
prove that he killed Rourke,

542
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:36,777
and he's confessing to
get out ahead of it,

543
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,479
and get the best
deal that he can.

544
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,848
If only he'd followed
instruction.

545
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,333
Come to me instead.

546
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:44,452
Probably thought you were
part of the conspiracy.

547
00:20:44,454 --> 00:20:47,004
I suppose, in a sense, I am.

548
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,543
So, what now?

549
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:54,045
We've done as
Moriarty asked.

550
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:55,513
I found Wallace
Rourke's killer

551
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,431
and brought him to justice.

552
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,799
Now we await his call.

553
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,101
And my answers.

554
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:02,169
Personal security expert
Daren Sutter,

555
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:06,273
who was best known for his book
Friend or Foe, has confessed

556
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,275
to the murder of Wallace Rourke,

557
00:21:08,277 --> 00:21:11,112
whom he alleges was responsible
for the murder of his sister

558
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:12,563
22 years ago.

559
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:14,348
Leah Sutter, who is
Daren's older sister...

560
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,901
Okay, that is
not distracting at all.

561
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:19,820
Moriarty must know about
Sutter's arrest by now.

562
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,122
Why hasn't he called?

563
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,190
Moriarty, as you
so eloquently put it,

564
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:24,959
is an assassin pimp.

565
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:26,344
Did you really think
if you solved this case,

566
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:27,495
he'd keep up to his side
of the bargain?

567
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:28,696
I'm well aware that

568
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:30,381
Moriarty is playing with me.

569
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:32,166
Just because I can't predict
his next move,

570
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:36,036
doesn't mean I can't
expect him to make one.

571
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,673
Why were you at the police
station the other day

572
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:40,141
when Sutter came
in to confess?

573
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:41,976
I needed to talk to Gregson.

574
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,811
Was this a continuation of your
earlier mysterious conversation

575
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:45,763
with him or is it
an entirely new one?

576
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:00,961
I see Daren Sutter
is under arrest.

577
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:02,196
Congratulations.

578
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:03,781
I held up my half
of the bargain,

579
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,666
I expect you to do the same.

580
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:09,537
To the contrary, you've only
revealed part of the truth.

581
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:10,838
I owe you nothing.

582
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,173
You want the whole truth?

583
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:13,591
I know a great deal
more than you think.

584
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:15,092
I know that Sutter
was your target all along.

585
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:16,927
I know that you had him
under surveillance.

586
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,629
I know that you didn't want
to reveal that surveillance

587
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,598
to the authorities, so you
utilized me to expose him.

588
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,416
You're slipping, Holmes.

589
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:25,019
I'm referring to the truth
about Leah Sutter's murder.

590
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:26,920
Wallace Rourke killed her.

591
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:29,857
No, in fact, he did not.

592
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:30,975
He had an alibi.

593
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,943
Let me guess:
his mother swears

594
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:35,362
that she dealt him into her
bridge hand that evening.

595
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:37,031
After Rourke left the Army,

596
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:39,233
his mail went to his mother's
house in Connecticut,

597
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:40,735
but Rourke did not.

598
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:43,204
He was in Saudi Arabia doing
off-the-books work

599
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,705
for an American oil company.

600
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:47,941
He didn't return
until March 1991.

601
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,911
Sutter swears
that he saw him.

602
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,213
Sutter is wrong.

603
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:53,998
He killed the wrong man.

604
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,884
And your work is far from done.

605
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:58,302
Finish it.

606
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:13,564
Oh, good, you're awake.

607
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:14,866
Oh... how long was I out?

608
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:16,451
107 minutes.

609
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,503
Precisely enough time to cycle
through all five stages

610
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:20,538
of REM and non-REM sleep,

611
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,240
leaving your mind clear
for the day's labor.

612
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:26,211
Oh... have you made
any progress?

613
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:27,795
If by "progress""

614
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:30,048
you mean have I proven
that Moriarty was wrong

615
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,217
and Wallace Rourke killed
Daren Sutter's sister,

616
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,686
as Daren and myself had
come to believe, then, no,

617
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:36,804
I have made
the opposite of progress.

618
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:38,256
Ugh. So Rourke was
in Saudi Arabia

619
00:23:38,258 --> 00:23:39,557
at the time of the murder.

620
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,092
I can't prove that.

621
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:44,229
Nor, unfortunately, can I prove
he was anywhere else.

622
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,965
After Rourke left the Army
in 1990,

623
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,866
his mail and
his personal effects

624
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,536
went to his mother's place
in Connecticut.

625
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:53,938
There is nothing to suggest
that Rourke accompanied them.

626
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,275
There's no credit card
purchases, no...

627
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:59,410
no bank withdrawals...
no financial activity at all.

628
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:00,878
Monetarily... a ghost.

629
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,714
Maybe his mother paid
for everything.

630
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:04,582
An arrangement
which is not unheard of.

631
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:08,720
However, Rourke's
medical records show

632
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,388
that shortly before
he left the Army,

633
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,956
he refilled his
malaria pill prescription.

634
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,575
He also received
a typhoid booster.

635
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:16,627
So it's possible that he was
planning to stay in Kuwait.

636
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,463
He also received
a vaccination for...

637
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:21,099
meningococcal disease.

638
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:23,434
Inoculation for that disease
is only required

639
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:26,637
for travel to
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia!

640
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,906
Again, not proof.

641
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:30,308
But it is a suggestive detail

642
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,859
which I should have noticed
before.

643
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:35,530
I also should have noticed
the $30,000 deposit

644
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,449
made to Rourke from a shell
corporation in April 1991,

645
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,418
mostly likely a payment
for his services

646
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,870
to the oil company.
Still not conclusive.

647
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,822
And our assignment was to find
the killer for Wallace Rourke,

648
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,324
not Leah Sutter.

649
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:49,377
A case which-- I have just
bothered to find out--

650
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:51,829
unidentified fingerprints were
found on Leah's door

651
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:53,214
after her death.

652
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,498
Now they could have been
left behind by someone

653
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,167
unrelated to the case.

654
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:57,635
They could have been left
by a deliveryman, pizza boy.

655
00:24:57,637 --> 00:24:59,220
But the police
have long suspected

656
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:00,638
they were left by Leah's killer.

657
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,507
I'm guessing that
the fingerprints

658
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,008
were not a match
for Wallace Rourke?

659
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,676
Correct.

660
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:08,680
All of which would suggest
that Moriarty may be right.

661
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:10,615
Daren Sutter killed
an innocent man.

662
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:13,534
Maybe Moriarty's right
because he set Sutter up.

663
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:14,786
An excellent theory,

664
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:16,020
hindered only by the fact

665
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:17,705
that it is nigh on impossible.

666
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,290
It's completely possible.

667
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,958
Moriarty said he did
things like this for a living.

668
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,994
Daren Sutter saw
his sister's killer

669
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:24,528
running away from her body.

670
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,963
His face is etched onto

671
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:27,548
his brain.
How does anyone,

672
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,933
including Moriarty,

673
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:30,868
trick a man into killing someone
other than

674
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,837
the person he saw?
It's been over 20 years.

675
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,538
Memories get distorted,
influenced...

676
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,875
No, no, not the memory of
the person who took your sister,

677
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:39,927
who took someone you loved
from you.

678
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:45,049
It is a conundrum.

679
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:48,936
But once solved...

680
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:51,722
we will have the complete truth
which Moriarty has requested.

681
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,608
This taste in my mouth
is horrid.

682
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,734
If you want to use the toilet,
I'll just turn away.

683
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:06,204
You didn't have asparagus
last night, did you?

684
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:08,447
Why do you think Moriarty's
putting you through all this?

685
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,909
Well, he obviously
views me as an enemy.

686
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:14,245
Yes, but why?

687
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:16,964
I must have interrupted

688
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,249
some criminal enterprise
of his in London.

689
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:19,750
Well, then why
didn't he just kill you?

690
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:20,968
Why do what he did
to Irene,

691
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,854
and why is he making you

692
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:24,939
jump through hoops,
now that you're in New York?

693
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:28,776
Uh, he's a more
complex opponent

694
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:30,728
than I have faced
in some time.

695
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,431
Are you even afraid of him?

696
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,285
I find fear to be
an unproductive filter

697
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,787
with which to view the world.
It dampens my powers of...

698
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:42,106
Can't you just answer a question
like a normal human being?

699
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:43,241
As I mentioned earlier,

700
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,042
he clearly doesn't
want to kill me,

701
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:46,828
so, no, I'm not afraid.

702
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:49,780
Well, there are ways
to hurt you

703
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:52,667
that do not involve
hurting... you.

704
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,643
Watson, you know that
there are risks entailed

705
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:06,464
in the work that I--
that we-- perform.

706
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:08,766
You cannot do the work
without undertaking those risks.

707
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:09,984
But know this:

708
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,352
as far as Moriarty
is concerned,

709
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:14,272
I will never allow
any harm to come to you.

710
00:27:14,274 --> 00:27:16,257
Not ever.

711
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,276
You can't promise that.

712
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:19,827
And yet, I have.

713
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:22,997
Now...

714
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,749
given the amount of questions
which need answering,

715
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:25,983
I propose that we split up.

716
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:27,952
I will go and see
Mr. Sutter again,

717
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:30,288
see if he can't shed some more
light on the situation.

718
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,173
You pay a visit to Mrs. Sutter.

719
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:33,791
See if you can't
convince her

720
00:27:33,793 --> 00:27:35,793
that access to
the firm's client list

721
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:38,963
might help us find the man who
put them in this predicament.

722
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:40,348
Okay?

723
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:50,775
Wallace Rourke
killed my sister.

724
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:53,361
The evidence suggests...
What evidence?

725
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,012
It's an assortment of facts

726
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,731
arranged to support
what you want to believe.

727
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,065
I don't want
to believe anything.

728
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,735
I want to make sense
of this.

729
00:28:00,737 --> 00:28:02,987
I acknowledge that the evidence
that Rourke was

730
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:05,790
out of the country
is-is far from iron-clad.

731
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,825
And yet it seems unwise
to ignore the possibility

732
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:09,043
that you were misled.

733
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:12,079
If you were, who stands
to benefit from that?

734
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,548
You're being played.

735
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,917
Manipulated by whoever
sent you down this path.

736
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,668
Well aware of that possibility.

737
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,471
And yet, as unlikely
as it seems,

738
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:22,473
it is at least possible

739
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:24,675
that you were tricked
into killing the wrong man.

740
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:26,377
Okay.

741
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,095
You said the other day
I'm a terrible liar?

742
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,047
You tell me if
I'm lying right now.

743
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,434
Wallace Rourke
murdered my sister.

744
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:37,605
If there is a crime to be done,

745
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:38,839
a paper to be abstracted,

746
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:40,308
a house to be rifled,

747
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,776
a man to be removed...

748
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:43,344
the word is passed to me,

749
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,896
the matter is planned...
No, I'm sorry.

750
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,782
I've never heard
this man's voice before.

751
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:50,501
Like I said, Mr. Holmes and I

752
00:28:50,503 --> 00:28:52,703
believe that he may be targeting
one of your clients.

753
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:55,172
Now, if you would allow me
to look at your list,

754
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:56,757
we might be able to figure out...
I'm sorry.

755
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,143
Our clients need to be able
to trust our discretion

756
00:28:59,145 --> 00:29:01,329
as much as our ability
to keep them safe.

757
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:03,898
And as far as your theory
that this man is behind

758
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,017
some conspiracy
to bring Daren down...

759
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,436
You found bugs in here,
didn't you?

760
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:11,222
Let's say that we did.

761
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:13,107
There's a lot of people
who'd like to know

762
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:14,609
what's going on
inside these walls.

763
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:16,594
And even if the man
you're referring to

764
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,512
is surveilling us,

765
00:29:18,514 --> 00:29:20,831
he couldn't possibly have set
Daren up to kill the wrong man.

766
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,200
Daren saw Wallace Rourke's
face that night.

767
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:25,786
Isn't it possible
that he got it wrong?

768
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:28,439
That after so many years
of wanting to find the killer,

769
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,324
he was ready
to believe he had?

770
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:33,644
There's no way he would make
a mistake like that.

771
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,796
You have to understand--
for Daren...

772
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:38,249
his life is divided
into two halves:

773
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:40,618
before Leah's murder, and after.

774
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,970
Did you know Daren
before she died?

775
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:44,622
I wish I had.

776
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:48,259
I actually met Daren
at a candlelight vigil

777
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:50,094
the town was holding for Leah.

778
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:53,180
That is a very complicated time
to get involved.

779
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:55,349
It was a complicated
time to meet.

780
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,852
We didn't get involved
until a few months after.

781
00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,271
Daren found closure

782
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:02,806
when he killed Wallace Rourke.

783
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:05,809
Am I sad that he's in jail?

784
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:08,613
Yes.

785
00:30:08,615 --> 00:30:12,083
But I'm also grateful
that he finally...

786
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:13,501
found some peace.

787
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:19,957
Sherlock? You here?

788
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:27,932
Oh. Well, my meeting
with Kate Sutter was a bust.

789
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:29,967
She's not giving up
their client list.

790
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:32,553
Her husband refused
to discuss his enemies,

791
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:35,022
as that would entertain the
notion that he was being set up.

792
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:38,225
So I began
to catalogue them myself,

793
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,778
using some files I got
from Detective Bell.

794
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,731
As the head of a successful
risk management firm,

795
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:48,018
Sutter's put away a long list
of stalkers, abusive husbands,

796
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,487
and dangerous obsessives.

797
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,539
Well, it looks like
a pretty competitive field.

798
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:53,741
On top of that,
he shared his obsession

799
00:30:53,743 --> 00:30:55,409
with his sister's killer
with the world,

800
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:56,661
so there's no shortage of people

801
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,829
who know about
his Achilles' heel.

802
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:01,532
Are you all right?

803
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:03,050
Yeah, I'm just a bit stiff.

804
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:04,502
Been sitting for too long.

805
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,810
I'm just...

806
00:31:12,812 --> 00:31:15,045
Forgive me.

807
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:17,815
The last few days have
just-just, uh, taken their toll.

808
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:21,385
To be so...

809
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:25,106
so close some answers which
I've sought for... so long.

810
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:29,110
I cannot come up empty-handed.

811
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:34,565
Why don't you go get
something to eat?

812
00:31:35,534 --> 00:31:36,917
I will clean up.

813
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:12,870
I was just thinking how
difficult this case is for you.

814
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:14,622
I know how badly
Moriarty hurt you,

815
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:16,323
and I was just thinking, I wish

816
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,509
that I could fix it for you.

817
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:21,328
I appreciate the sentiment,
Watson,

818
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,632
but I fear that your goal
may be unobtainable.

819
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:27,168
What about Daren Sutter?

820
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,619
I mean, he's a lot like you.

821
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:31,388
Except he got what he wanted.

822
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,641
He's at peace now.

823
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:35,392
We've been trying
to identify people

824
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:37,144
who wanted to tear Sutter down,

825
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:40,097
but what if he was tricked
into killing Wallace Rourke

826
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,132
by someone who wanted
to lift him up?

827
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:57,254
If this is about Daren,

828
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:58,572
I don't feel comfortable
answering questions

829
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:00,007
without his attorney.

830
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:01,592
Well, actually, Mrs. Sutter,
this is about you.

831
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:03,744
We were hoping that you might
be able to confirm

832
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:06,380
exactly when you met
your husband.

833
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:09,133
Well, as I told Ms. Watson,
it was in 1991,

834
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:10,601
at a vigil for his sister Leah.

835
00:33:10,603 --> 00:33:12,219
So that would be
after her death?

836
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:13,604
Obviously.

837
00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:15,940
Well, being with Daren
as long as you have,

838
00:33:15,942 --> 00:33:18,392
I'd assume you know as much
about her case as anyone.

839
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,093
So surely you know
that partial fingerprints

840
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:22,262
were found on her front door
that night.

841
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:23,397
They were
never identified,

842
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,865
but police thought
there was a chance

843
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,952
they belonged
to the killer.

844
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,620
They belonged to you.

845
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:31,605
'Cause you were the one who
came through the door

846
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,123
that night; not your husband.

847
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:36,276
You handled
Ms. Watson's phone yesterday.

848
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:38,295
We were able to pull your prints
and compare them

849
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:39,580
to the ones from
Leah's house.

850
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:40,781
They matched.

851
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:42,583
That means you lied to me.

852
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,551
You did know Daren
before Leah died.

853
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,670
We checked
public records.

854
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:49,340
You were married to
another man at this time.

855
00:33:49,342 --> 00:33:52,149
And and Mr. Sutter
were having an affair.

856
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:53,538
Okay.

857
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:57,564
So Daren and I were together
before Leah died-- so what?

858
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,266
So...

859
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:01,101
now we know why
he was so certain

860
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:03,070
he killed the right man
all those months ago.

861
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:05,522
'Cause you told him
it was the right man.

862
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:08,242
He never saw
the killer's face; you did.

863
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:11,144
But you couldn't admit that
without revealing your affair.

864
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:13,530
And, so, Daren
became the official witness,

865
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:16,166
relaying all the details you
saw, as if you were the one

866
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:17,818
who that came in
the door that night.

867
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,986
Problem solved.

868
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:20,704
Till the police
couldn't find the man

869
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:22,006
you described to Daren.

870
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:23,757
That was hard on Daren.

871
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,509
And you.

872
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:28,345
22 years later,
you came across

873
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:30,700
a man who you
thought would pass

874
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:32,725
for an older version

875
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:35,002
of the man in
this sketch.

876
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:36,954
And that was
Wallace Rourke.

877
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:38,889
And the only way you could
give your husband the peace

878
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:42,276
that he'd never had was to insist
that Wallace Rourke

879
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:44,278
was the man that
you saw that night.

880
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,513
He was the man I saw that night.

881
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:48,399
Rourke killed Leah.

882
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:49,850
As a matter of fact,
he didn't.

883
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:52,569
We were just able to confirm,
a little while ago,

884
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:56,123
he wasn't even in the country
at the time of the murder.

885
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,659
You saw someone else
that night.

886
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:02,296
Now listen,

887
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:06,333
your husband is gonna find
out about this sooner or later.

888
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:08,419
Why don't you
do yourself a favor,

889
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:11,088
and tell us
the whole story.

890
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:18,645
I loved Leah, too.

891
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:19,897
But she wasn't my sister.

892
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:21,732
She was Daren's.

893
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:26,687
What happened that night,
it... it changed him.

894
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:28,689
I didn't love him any less.

895
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:31,058
If anything, I loved him more.

896
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,027
Doing what we do here

897
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:34,695
and doing it well,
that helped him.

898
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,497
He started to get better.

899
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:39,533
But then...
when we came up

900
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:43,037
on the 20th anniversary
of Leah's death...

901
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,039
he started to
slip away again.

902
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,406
We tried everything:

903
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:48,926
all kinds of therapy,
antidepressants...

904
00:35:48,928 --> 00:35:50,844
none of it helped.

905
00:35:50,846 --> 00:35:52,429
And a few months ago,

906
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:56,550
I came home... and I
found him with a gun.

907
00:35:56,552 --> 00:36:00,220
He had already written me
a note saying good-bye.

908
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:03,273
I talked him down,
but I knew

909
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:05,142
it was just going
to be a matter of time

910
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,167
before he tried again.

911
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:10,147
I had to do something.

912
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:12,783
He looked enough like
the sketch to fool Daren.

913
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:14,151
That combined
with your insistence

914
00:36:14,153 --> 00:36:16,153
that it was the same man
was all it took.

915
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:18,739
This was the only
way to save Daren.

916
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:22,042
No, that's what 72-hour
psych holds are for.

917
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:24,495
Rourke was an innocent man.

918
00:36:24,497 --> 00:36:26,380
I didn't relish
Mr. Rourke's death,

919
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:31,218
but between him and Daren,
it wasn't a hard choice.

920
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,087
Neither is this:

921
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:34,755
You're under arrest.

922
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:39,845
So now that we have
the whole truth,

923
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,295
why do I feel so lousy?

924
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:42,846
That's Moriarty's
intention.

925
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:45,799
I think this is supposed
to be a stupid lesson.

926
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:47,901
Show me a man
who craves vengeance

927
00:36:47,903 --> 00:36:50,020
and can destroy
the lives of others.

928
00:36:50,022 --> 00:36:54,191
You think this is his way
of getting you to back off?

929
00:36:54,193 --> 00:36:56,977
I think I'm gonna go
and visit Daren Sutter again.

930
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:59,163
I feel an obligation
to break the news

931
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:01,615
of his wife's
deceit personally.

932
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:03,984
I'll meet you back
at the brownstone.

933
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:06,787
Uh, I'm just curious

934
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,322
why you're the one
telling me all this.

935
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:11,491
I thought you deserved to know.

936
00:37:11,493 --> 00:37:14,661
You said you understood me.

937
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:17,297
You experienced loss,
too, but what,

938
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:20,517
you couldn't wait
for... one more night?

939
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:23,353
After I suffered
through 22 years?

940
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:25,189
I'll delve into Leah's case.

941
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:28,892
I'll do everything possible
to bring her killer to justice.

942
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,011
Wow, you still
don't get it, do you?

943
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:33,897
Unless you plan on finding
the man who murdered my sister

944
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:37,117
and bringing him back here
to me so I can strangle him

945
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,003
with my own hands, there's
never gonna be any justice.

946
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:42,914
I've just been informed

947
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:44,324
of Mrs. Sutter's arrest.

948
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:47,295
Finally,
you've earned your answers.

949
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:49,663
I don't suppose I could convince
you to deliver them in person?

950
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:52,199
The truth, Holmes,
is that I hope we never meet.

951
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:54,201
My sense is that
would be a great shame.

952
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:55,302
Mm, for once of us.

953
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:57,871
My point.
We can end this now.

954
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:01,175
I can promise you our paths
will never cross again.

955
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:03,677
Or, you may have your answers.

956
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,063
I'm curious to see
which you choose.

957
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:16,089
Watson.

958
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:18,892
Just checking in.
How did Daren take the news?

959
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:20,727
As well as can be expected.

960
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:22,579
Have you heard anything
from Moriarty yet?

961
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:23,914
No, afraid not.

962
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,232
I'm returning home.

963
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,783
I'll be there shortly.

964
00:38:48,756 --> 00:38:52,259
What do you
think's inside?

965
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:54,261
In this day and age,
the simplest way

966
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:56,146
to track someone
is via their cell phone.

967
00:38:56,148 --> 00:38:59,616
You cloned the phone that
Moriarty's been using to contact us.

968
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:02,435
I did.
Right after you told me

969
00:39:02,437 --> 00:39:04,738
that you'd never
let Moriarty hurt me.

970
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,407
I thought you'd try and pull
something like this.

971
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:09,960
You asked me
to be your partner.

972
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:10,976
You are my partner.

973
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:12,080
You lied to me
about hearing from Moriarty

974
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:14,081
so you could
come here on your own.

975
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,299
Watson...

976
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:20,003
...most puzzles I see
from the outside

977
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:21,722
and it gives me
a certain clarity.

978
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:24,224
I am right in the
center of this one.

979
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:28,145
It has blurred my vision...
to say the least.

980
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:30,430
I just... I just
lied to protect you.

981
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:32,132
I didn't ask you
to protect me.

982
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:34,801
And I did not sign on
to work with you

983
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:37,070
to be put on the sidelines
every time you or-or Gregson

984
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:38,999
or anyone decides
it's too dangerous.

985
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:39,741
You want the danger.

986
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:41,570
No, I want to know
that I'm not kidding

987
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,027
myself by staying with you.

988
00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:47,030
The reasons I'm
here are personal.

989
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:49,816
I could say the same thing.

990
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:53,486
I have been with you
every step of the way

991
00:39:53,488 --> 00:39:55,088
these past couple of weeks.

992
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,840
We have worked hard
on this case.

993
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:59,009
Whatever answers he's got
in there for you,

994
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:00,544
I deserve them, too.

995
