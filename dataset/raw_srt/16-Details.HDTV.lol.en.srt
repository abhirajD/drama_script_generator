1
00:00:03,978 --> 00:00:05,546
Sherlock, you home?

2
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:15,928
I think we need a new bulb
in the foyer.

3
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:18,214
Tell me where
Holmes is,

4
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:19,715
and I'll let
you live.

5
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,636
You looking for this?

6
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

7
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:30,526
Where is Holmes?

8
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:36,181
That's pathetic.

9
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,285
Sherlock?

10
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:45,791
Now you hit me.
Seriously?

11
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:47,326
What is your damage?

12
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:48,744
Look, given that you
were held at gunpoint

13
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:50,329
in this very room
little over a week ago,

14
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,081
I thought, perhaps,
a test of your

15
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,666
ability to defend yourself
was in order.

16
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:55,367
It was.

17
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,469
You have much to learn about
the art of self-preservation.

18
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,555
Okay, if you ever
do that again, I swear...

19
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:01,507
You'll what?
Fall over again?

20
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,142
Look, the work I do
is dangerous.

21
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:04,343
You know this,

22
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:05,761
yet you insist
on accompanying me

23
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,346
virtually everywhere I go.

24
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:09,014
Last week, a violent criminal

25
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:11,233
infiltrated this brownstone
while I wasn't here.

26
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:13,719
Hmm? How?
You opened the door for him.

27
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:15,053
He was a federal agent.

28
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:17,406
Right, they never
do anything wrong, hmm?

29
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:18,908
Realizing that you
were in physical danger

30
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,992
was difficult for me.

31
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,277
If anything ever
happened to you,

32
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,112
I'm not sure
I could forgive myself.

33
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,530
Okay, this is not
how you express concern

34
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,064
for someone
that you want to keep safe.

35
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:27,249
Quite right,
so I've reached out

36
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,584
to a handful
of martial artists

37
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:30,286
who reside in the city,
each one of them

38
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:31,954
an expert in his
or her fighting style.

39
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,405
My hope is some
combination of them

40
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:34,590
will agree to train you.

41
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,342
In the meantime,
you should expect

42
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,711
more guerilla-style tests
of your ability

43
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:40,713
to fight back.

44
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,966
You have been warned.

45
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,467
<i>This is Captain Gregson.</i>

46
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,186
<i>Leave a message.</i>

47
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:49,021
<i>Hey, Captain, it's Bell.</i>

48
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:50,272
Uh, sorry to call so late,

49
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:51,923
but I thought you
would want to know

50
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:53,442
the Rodriguez thing
is taken care of.

51
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:56,695
He finally copped
to that holdup in Queens.

52
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:59,031
I'm headed home now.

53
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,367
I'll bring you up to speed
in the morning.

We're still waiting
for ballistics to come back,

58
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:07,249
but inital indications are

59
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:10,805
that this was done
with a semiautomatic MP5.

60
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,708
The MP5 meets
all the requirements

61
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,044
for a good,
old-fashioned drive-by.

62
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:17,379
It can be held with
one hand by a lone driver,

63
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,714
it has
a large magazine,

64
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:21,216
and in the hands
of a marksman,

65
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,352
it's quite accurate
at close range.

66
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:25,387
You, sir, were not
assailed by a marksman.

67
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:27,890
Well, thank God for bad aim.

68
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:29,224
And air bags.

69
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,360
Yep, I can tell from
the pattern of the holes

70
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:33,896
that the bullets were fired
in three-round bursts

71
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:36,949
from a rifle barrel
as opposed to a smoothbore,

72
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,068
which suggests that
whoever's behind the attack

73
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,371
has access to high-level
firearm augmentation.

74
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,156
Even if the location
of the holes

75
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,575
reveals him
to have terrible aim.

76
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:48,160
You really shouldn't
have jerked your wheel.

77
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,828
You would've come out
without a scratch.

78
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,213
Now you tell me.

79
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:53,031
It's funny, Detective--
the second I heard

80
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,532
about the attempt on your life,
I dove into your case history.

81
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:59,057
I thought it would be
only a matter of time

82
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,359
before the culprit's identity
presented itself.

83
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,777
I was wrong.

84
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,446
You've done excellent work
over the years.

85
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:05,131
Made a lot of enemies.
There's no shortage

86
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,749
of people who would like
to see you dead.

87
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,451
You say it like
it's a good thing.

88
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:09,952
Well, there is,
in my humble opinion,

89
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:12,621
no greater compliment
an investigator can receive.

90
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:14,740
Speaks to the quality
of your work.

91
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:17,376
Well, do you think we should
dive back into the files

92
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:19,578
and get more specific
about who was trying

93
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,580
to compliment Detective Bell
last night?

94
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,432
Uh, no need,
actually.

95
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:25,968
I know exactly who did this.

96
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,771
Curtis Bradshaw.

97
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:30,639
Old-school gangster

98
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,857
and all-around
scumbag.

99
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:33,309
He was the target
of a detail

100
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,610
I was assigned to
in '09,

101
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:36,061
back when I was
still a uni.

102
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:37,893
Aspiring drug kingpin, I see.

103
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:38,974
At the height
of his power,

104
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:40,975
he was selling product
all over the city.

105
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:43,828
Had a crew of almost 100,
and they were moving in

106
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,864
on other gangs' territories,
so it was getting bloody.

107
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:47,564
Hence the detail.

108
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,516
Says here he was suspected
of crimes

109
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,318
ranging from racketeering
to torture

110
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,736
and murder.

111
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:54,404
Yet he was arrested in 2011

112
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,241
on the mere charge
of possessing stolen property.

113
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:59,243
Sentence to three years,
just served 18 months.

114
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,947
Bradshaw was smarter
than your average street thug.

115
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,499
He always flew
under the radar;

116
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,067
kept just enough
distance between himself

117
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:09,086
and the crimes that were
being committed by his crew.

118
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:11,955
One of the detectives
on the detail...

119
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,874
well, he got frustrated.

120
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:15,408
Stole some heroin
from the evidence room

121
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,344
and planted it
in Bradshaw's home.

122
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:19,129
Well, Bradshaw
was arrested,

123
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:20,914
but then, a few days later,

124
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,749
someone called
with an anonymous tip,

125
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,184
told I.A. what happened.

126
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:26,804
We had no choice
but to cut Bradshaw loose.

127
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,605
Now, I continued
to work the detail,

128
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:29,807
went undercover
for a while,

129
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:31,775
got to know his crew
inside and out.

130
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:34,228
Still couldn't find
enough evidence to connect him

131
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,979
to the drugs
they were trafficking, so...

132
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,815
So you "Caponed" him.

133
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:38,949
You arrested him

134
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:40,200
on a less
significant charge

135
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:41,869
just to get him off the street.

136
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:43,987
While he was gone, we continued
to chip away at his empire.

137
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:45,489
I went after his lieutenants--

138
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,708
they weren't nearly
as careful as Bradshaw was--

139
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,110
and I managed to put
most of them away.

140
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:51,462
Six months into
his sentence,

141
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:53,613
all he had left
were a few corners.

142
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:55,782
Obviously you did a lot
of damage, but how can you

143
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,751
be sure it's the same shooter
from last night?

144
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,638
This was Bradshaw's baby.

145
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,007
It's also the car
that pulled up alongside me.

146
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,592
Now, he told me before his trial

147
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,811
he was going to come
after me himself.

148
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:09,513
And last night,
he finally did.

149
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:11,181
Obviously, I can't
have Bell here

150
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,649
investigating
his own attempted murder.

151
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:14,902
And since we just put eyes
on Bradshaw,

152
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:16,487
I thought maybe you could

153
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:18,021
come with me
to question him?

154
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,306
I suppose I could
lend my services.

155
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:21,742
Thanks for not making me beg.

156
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:27,364
Hey, you got a message
at the intake desk.

157
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,815
We were on our way up,

158
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:30,367
said we'd pass it along.

159
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,836
What kind of a name
is Mr. Cheese?

160
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:35,706
He's, uh, one of
my CIs; he's shy.

161
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,374
What about last night?

162
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,842
Yeah, it was just...

163
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:40,294
Car took the worst of it.

164
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,162
I'm glad you're doing okay.

165
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:46,216
How many times
did you and her have sex?

166
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:47,351
God.

167
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,052
My over/under is ten.

168
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:50,971
Officer Reyes
is an old friend.

169
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,973
Her partner doesn't
like you very much.

170
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:54,391
It's probably because
he'd like to have sex

171
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,176
with her as well--
and when I say "as well".

172
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,561
I mean in addition to
and separate from,

173
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,947
not including you
as a third party.

174
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,899
I know what you meant.

175
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:03,483
She boxes.

176
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,452
I can tell from her knuckles
and the tape residue.

177
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:06,954
Perhaps she would agree
to spar with you,

178
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:08,956
give me an idea of, uh,
what you might be like

179
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,490
with an opponent
in your similar weight class.

180
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,409
You sure this sudden
new interest in my safety

181
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,161
has nothing to do
with watching two women

182
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:15,495
engage in some foxy boxing?

183
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:16,880
You think you're foxy?

184
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,365
You two ready?

185
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,867
<i>50 on my kid right here.</i>

186
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:23,203
- Aah!
- That's all day.

187
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:24,537
Let's play some "D,"
let's play some defense.

188
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,672
Yeah, let's go,
let's go.

189
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:27,307
Guys, come on,
you got to play some "D."

190
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:28,842
Curtis Bradshaw.

191
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:31,228
Captain Gregson, NYPD.

192
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,880
These are my associates,
Holmes and Watson.

193
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:35,599
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

194
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,684
You're blocking my view.

195
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:39,519
Oh, yeah?

196
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:41,721
Imagine what the view's gonna
look like from the precinct.

197
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:43,774
Can you account for
your whereabouts

198
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:45,943
between the hours of 10:00
and 10:30 last night?

199
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,560
Why would I need to?

200
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:48,895
'Cause someone
took a few shots

201
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:50,831
at an old friend
of yours.

202
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,399
Detective Marcus Bell.

203
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:56,119
You know, I heard something
about that on the news.

204
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:59,456
Somebody fired a whole clip
into his car and didn't hit him.

205
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,291
See, the thing
with him is,

206
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:03,210
you got to aim low.

207
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:05,796
Your car was seen

208
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,914
leaving the scene
of the crime.

209
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,800
You're going to have to be
more specific.

210
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:11,018
I have a few.

211
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,186
1968 blue
Chevy Biscayne.

212
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:14,771
Get out of here.

213
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,690
That car was stolen
two nights ago.

214
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:19,226
Did you report the car stolen?
Hey, you know what?

215
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:22,112
As a matter of fact,
I was going to do that today.

216
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:24,781
I'm going to ask you one
more time, Mr. Bradshaw:

217
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:27,150
Can you account for your
whereabouts or can't you?

218
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:29,303
Yo, he was with me, man.

219
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:30,621
We went to the movies.

220
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,039
We didn't leave
till after midnight.

221
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,123
No, man, you're wrong.

222
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,491
He was with me last night.

223
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,793
He was playing cards
at my cousin's place.

224
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:39,997
You pick the alibi
you like the best.

225
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,666
You a gambling man,
Mr. Bradshaw?

226
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,618
I've been known to make
the occasional wager, but...

227
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,088
I bet you I can put that ball
in that hoop from here.

228
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:53,093
If I win, tell us where you
abandoned the car last night.

229
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:54,794
You win, tell us nothing.

230
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:57,981
British globetrotter here.

231
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:01,301
Do you agree to the
terms of the bet or not?

232
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,271
What you got, homey?

233
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,807
What you got?
What you got?

234
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,528
Look at this guy.
He's a clown.

235
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,146
Look at this guy.

236
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:16,867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

237
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:19,336
He wasn't going to tell us
anything anyway.

238
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,321
You gonna get
that ball, right?

239
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:31,014
Marcus "Bulletproof" Bell.

240
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:33,550
I take it you heard
about what happened last night.

241
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:34,801
No thanks to you.

242
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:37,137
I had to hear about it
on the news.

243
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:41,441
So I hit you up
at the station.

244
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:43,560
I wanted to make sure
you was okay.

245
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:45,612
Now, I know you don't like
me calling you there,

246
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:46,780
so I used a code name.

247
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:47,898
Well, your old
gang name

248
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,950
is not a code name.

249
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,738
So, this guy, the shooter...

250
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,156
what'd he come at you with?

251
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:59,326
Modified MP5.

252
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,030
You know, um,
I still know some people.

253
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:05,749
I could ask around,
see who's strapped

254
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,334
with that kind of hardware.

255
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,836
Not without violating
your parole, you can't.

256
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:13,757
Uh, these are for you.

257
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,176
It's just a few things
to tide you over.

258
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:21,431
Appreciate it.

259
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:24,384
Been pretty sick
of the unsold burgers

260
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:26,486
they let me take home
from work every night.

261
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,188
Hoping to see
my PO next week,

262
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,557
see if he can hook me up
with a better job.

263
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,993
Hey.

264
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:34,611
You're not him,
by the way.

265
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:37,030
My parole officer.

266
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:38,281
You don't have to case my place

267
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,899
to see if I've been
up to anything.

268
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,234
I'm not casing
anything, Andre.

269
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,086
What, you think
I'm stupid, Marcus?

270
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:45,738
You've only been
out a few weeks.

271
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,424
I'm just trying to
look out for you.

272
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:49,209
You don't got to look out
for me, okay?

273
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,343
I look out for you.

274
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,461
I'm the big brother here.

275
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:53,713
Andre...
I'm serious, Marcus.

276
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:56,383
I know you're embarrassed.

277
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:59,219
A cop with an ex-con
in the family.

278
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:02,189
But it is what it is.

279
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:05,792
When Detective Bell
said that Curtis Bradshaw

280
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,527
was smarter
than the average thug,

281
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,529
he was putting it mildly.

282
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:11,264
He never came within 1,000 yards

283
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,099
of the drugs
he was distributing.

284
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,168
He allowed a small cadre
of trusted lieutenants

285
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,487
to oversee almost
every transaction.

286
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:20,740
I'm beginning to see why
the detective on his detail

287
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,626
felt compelled to plant
evidence in his home.

288
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,211
Mickey Hudson, right?

289
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,279
Most of these are his notes.

290
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:28,915
I was thinking he might be
a good person to talk to.

291
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,167
Yes, he might be.

292
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,285
If he wasn't so very dead.

293
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:34,638
Hudson was brought up
on charges in 2009,

294
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,507
committed suicide just
before the trial began.

295
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:39,259
Don't you think it's weird
that Bradshaw

296
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:40,727
went after Bell himself?

297
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:42,929
I mean, he doesn't like
to get his hands dirty.

298
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:46,016
So, why not farm out the hit
to one of his lieutenants?

299
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:48,568
His grudge with Bell is
very clearly personal.

300
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,520
Nothing makes a
smart man stupid

301
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,355
like a thirst
for vengeance.

302
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:55,408
As you well know,
I speak from experience.

303
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:01,281
I appreciate your help
with these files, by the way.

304
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:03,316
No, Bell is family
at this point.

305
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:06,503
Well, he's
an excellent resource.

306
00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:09,256
He's come to appreciate
the efficacy of my methods,

307
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:11,291
and he shares sensitive
information when needed.

308
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:13,210
Yeah. If he's murdered,

309
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:16,213
I'll have to start over
with another detective.

310
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:19,132
Well, I'm going to order
some Thai.

311
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:21,801
Do you want anything?

312
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,522
Ow!

313
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,858
What the hell was that about?!
Don't be cross.

314
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,359
It could've been a knife.

315
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,361
I told you to expect more
tests of your reflexes

316
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:33,146
while I await word from
potential trainers.

317
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:35,031
Because you're afraid
I might get hurt. I remember.

318
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:36,449
In case you haven't noticed,

319
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,618
the only person
who has been hurting me is you.

320
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,903
You're angry.
That's good.

321
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:41,688
Come on, come at me.
Come on. Come on!

322
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,573
These locks... you put them
in some special order

323
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:44,991
the other day, right?

324
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:47,360
They're arranged in
country of origin.

325
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,135
Do it again.

326
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,425
Excuse me, sir?

327
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:05,445
Sir, you can't sit there.

328
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:09,816
Sir!

329
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:12,686
Fine, have it your way.

330
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,437
I'm calling the police.

331
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:52,971
It's Paula, correct?

332
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:54,422
Officer Reyes.
Oh.

333
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:56,091
You, you're
the consultant, right?

334
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:57,292
Yep.

335
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,593
We have a mutual friend.

336
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,961
Detective Bell.

337
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,829
Although I've never
seen him naked.

338
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:03,631
Hey. Little respect.

339
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:05,884
I was wondering if you might
tell me where you box.

340
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,503
I'm looking for a gym
for my associate, Ms. Watson.

341
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,271
How did you
know I boxed?

342
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:12,307
No more talking.

343
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,476
Not now.

344
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:24,035
Captain.

345
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,653
If you're thinking
about pulling a rabbit

346
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,522
out of the hat,
get to it, would you?

347
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:30,658
Media's already working
a "killer cops" angle.

348
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,860
They think this is retribution

349
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:33,495
for the attack
on Detective Bell.

350
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,662
Ridiculous.

351
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:36,047
Astute, actually.

352
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,332
You think a cop did this?

353
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,866
I'm afraid I found evidence

354
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:43,037
that would suggest
that Detective Bell did this.

355
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,973
It's a boot print.

356
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:46,374
So what?

357
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:47,759
It's a size ten.

358
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,344
Pergotti.

359
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,513
I know I'm a detective, Holmes,

360
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,098
but part of a boot print

361
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,849
doesn't really tell me
a whole story.

362
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:57,185
I found this print
precisely where the killer

363
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,903
was standing when they
shot Curtis Bradshaw.

364
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:00,855
Then I remembered your
dark gray summer suit

365
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:02,240
you favored in September.

366
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:04,776
Always paired with
your brown Pergottis.

367
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,495
You are a size ten,
aren't you?

368
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:10,031
Captain.

369
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm confused.

370
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:13,168
You guys coming at me?

371
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,252
Of course not.

372
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:15,286
But the press

373
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,871
is just hung up on the timing.

374
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:19,124
It's just an ugly piece of luck.

375
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,708
If it's just about timing,
why is Holmes

376
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,410
standing in my house

377
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,762
talking about my shoes?

378
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,463
Did you guys forget
there were two uniforms

379
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,682
posted outside my door
all night last night

380
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:29,384
in case Bradshaw
came after me again?

381
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,918
That's not much of an
alibi, I'm afraid.

382
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,587
I've already calculated
six different ways

383
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,589
that you could have given
those patrolmen the slip.

384
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:37,442
Fine. Four avenues of escape,

385
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:39,060
plus two variations
on the fifth.

386
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,761
There's the back balcony,
the fire escape...

387
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:42,781
I know we're not the best
of friends or anything,

388
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:44,949
but do you honestly believe
I would kill a man?

389
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:47,285
Even one as worthless
as Curtis Bradshaw?

390
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,536
I should think
anyone might kill,

391
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:49,738
given the right circumstances.

392
00:15:51,574 --> 00:15:53,458
But no, I don't
think that you

393
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,794
would shoot a man
in cold blood.

394
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,078
Good.

395
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,246
Nevertheless, you
will need answers

396
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,497
rather than indignation

397
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,915
when these questions
are being posed

398
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,500
by someone other than us.

399
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,137
Can you give us a minute?

400
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,456
Water closet?

401
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,259
If that means bathroom,
I'm sure you can find it.

402
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:16,648
What's he mean,
questions being asked?

403
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,484
You guys got a print from a boot
a thousand guys must own.

404
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:22,687
We also got a perp
who took two center mass.

405
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,190
Just like they trained us
at the academy.

406
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,525
And nobody else with a gun
knows where to aim it?

407
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,360
You got any real suspects?

408
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:32,530
If we did, I wouldn't have to
put you on administrative duty.

409
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:38,703
Hey, I don't bench you,

410
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,338
how's it going to play?

411
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,458
We're going to color
inside the lines on this.

412
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,494
That way, when it's over,
everyone knows you're clean.

413
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:49,464
Whenever you're ready, Captain.

414
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,388
Whoever did this,
we're gonna find him.

415
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,440
I promise you.

416
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,009
You were held
at gunpoint?

417
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:04,312
We both were.
Me and Sherlock's friend.

418
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,563
His ex-dealer.

419
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:06,898
There was
a struggle.

420
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,617
Uh, the man with the gun
was incapacitated,

421
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,369
but then Rhys was shot
in the abdomen.

422
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,571
I was able to stabilize him
until the paramedics took over.

423
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,740
Did he pull through,
the man who was shot?

424
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,192
Yes, he did.
What about you?

425
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:21,079
Have you noticed any post-
traumatic symptoms in yourself?

426
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,213
Anxiety?

427
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,414
No.

428
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,482
Nightmares?

429
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:27,385
I-I've been sleeping just fine.

430
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,504
You know I've always
been supportive

431
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,055
of your exploration
of Sherlock's work,

432
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:34,409
but your pattern with him
has become troubling.

433
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,261
For one thing,
you haven't told him

434
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,713
you're no longer being paid
to serve as his sober companion.

435
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:40,481
And now it sounds
as if your life

436
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:41,933
is at risk in his home.

437
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,018
Oh, he would agree with you.

438
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,355
He's been pushing me
to learn self-defense.

439
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:51,442
When's the last time you talked
about boundaries with him?

440
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,195
Oh, I-I talk about them
all the time.

441
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:55,896
He-he doesn't always listen.

442
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:58,833
May I give you
my professional opinion?

443
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,251
Please.

444
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:03,755
It's time you moved on,
found a new client.

445
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:05,757
It's been a
grand adventure,

446
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,709
these last few months
with Sherlock,

447
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,744
but it's run its course.

448
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:15,266
But I'm not staying with him
for some "grand adventure."

449
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:18,720
His work placed you in
real physical danger.

450
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,905
You could have been killed.

451
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:26,644
You claim he respects you,
that he cares about your safety.

452
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,396
If he really cares,

453
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,599
and if he's really as smart
as you say he is, tell me,

454
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,519
why isn't he the one
telling you to move on?

455
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:47,632
Is another test
of my reflexes?

456
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:49,751
Because you're about
to see how quickly

457
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,085
I can call the police.

458
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,136
Watson, you startled me.

459
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:53,454
Sorry about the din.

460
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,973
I needed something
to obscure the sound

461
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:56,624
of my ballistics exam.

462
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,009
This is a residence.

463
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,978
There are people that live
in this neighborhood.

464
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,596
You don't do
a ballistics exam here.

465
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,847
As a matter of fact,

466
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,599
you don't do
a ballistics exam, period.

467
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,966
You let the police
do them.

468
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:07,185
Of course, you're right.

469
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,486
But I'm afraid,
in this instance,

470
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:09,737
surrendering this weapon
to the police

471
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:11,305
was the last thing I could do.

472
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:19,080
Glad you got
my message.

473
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,699
I just wanted to tell you
that I reached out.

474
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:24,669
Some of my old people,
they like their toys.

475
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:28,589
You know how to tune up an MP5,
these boys know you.

476
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:30,124
Man, what did I say?

477
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,843
Hold up, hold up.

478
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:34,545
I got a name. Tico Bettis.

479
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:36,631
Out of Bed-Stuy.
If he's the one

480
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,801
who tweaked that gun,
he might know who used it.

481
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,303
You're welcome.

482
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:43,504
You're not
allowed to be

483
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:45,106
in contact with
your old people.

484
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,274
I called a couple
of old friends

485
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:47,725
'cause my brother
got shot at.

486
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,478
You don't think the NYPD
knows about Tico?

487
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,364
My boss talked to him
and five just like him

488
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,566
before they pulled
my car out the gutter.

489
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,035
He's clean.

490
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:58,703
Your PO finds out
you've been talking

491
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:01,289
to your old friends,
you go back in.

492
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,623
For what? Nothing.

493
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,827
Hey, hey, I just wanted
to help, man.

494
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,196
Why don't you help yourself
for a change, huh?

495
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:10,965
You can't understand
that I... that I...

496
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,917
that I might want to do
something that matters?

497
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,386
Look, I know what
you're going through.

498
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,972
No, no, man, you got no idea.
Andre...

499
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:19,874
You got no idea
what this is like.

500
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:23,644
But who knows?

501
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:26,314
Maybe someday...

502
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,316
you will.

503
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,446
So, I got a text
to be here?

504
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,532
Yeah, he needs to talk
to you about something.

505
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:56,377
Are those bullet holes
in that dummy?

506
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:58,212
They are.
You know, if you fired a gun

507
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:00,765
in here, I could arrest you.
I do.

508
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,250
Someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

509
00:21:03,252 --> 00:21:05,803
Sherlock thinks that
someone's trying to frame you

510
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,605
for the murder
of Curtis Bradshaw.

511
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:10,475
Look, if this is about

512
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,143
those Pergottis again,
we're talking about a boot

513
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,529
you could buy in any
department store in the city.

514
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,763
If the guy
who killed Bradshaw

515
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,198
wanted me to
take the fall,

516
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,933
he's the worst frame-up artist
I've ever seen.

517
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,018
The boots were only
the first part of the plan.

518
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,637
The gun was the second.
What gun?

519
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,872
What are you
talking about?

520
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:25,873
Where'd you get that?

521
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,908
Your home.

522
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,743
No sooner
had I entered

523
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,495
your bathroom today
than I noticed

524
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,381
the unmistakable scent
of a recently expended firearm.

525
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:35,333
<i>I followed it</i>
<i>to an air-conditioning vent,</i>

526
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,068
<i>found this nine-millimeter</i>

527
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,553
tucked inside.

528
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,972
I've never seen
that gun before in my life.

529
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:42,623
I believe you.

530
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,793
Yet it was the last thing
Curtis Bradshaw saw in his.

531
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:48,062
I just compared the slugs
I fired into that dummy

532
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:49,430
with images from the ones

533
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:51,015
recovered from
Mr. Bradshaw's body.

534
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,935
Perfect match.

535
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,828
I just heard back
from the lab.

536
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,162
They confirmed
this is the gun

537
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,647
that was used to kill
Curtis Bradshaw.

538
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:07,698
Do tell.

539
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,149
I'm glad you found it.

540
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:10,834
What exactly compelled you
to go poke around

541
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:13,770
in Dumpsters in the neighborhood
where Bradshaw was shot?

542
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:15,942
A hunch.
Oh.

543
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:17,994
Well, I'm glad you found it.

544
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:19,929
What I'm less glad about

545
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:21,898
is that there were no prints
recovered.

546
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,600
So, technically,

547
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:26,169
you're still a suspect
in the shooting.

548
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:28,571
I.A. hasn't given you
any grief yet, have they?

549
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:29,956
Not yet.

550
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,959
All right, well,
keep your cool,

551
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:35,545
and we'll keep trying
to figure out

552
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:37,380
who pulled the trigger.

553
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:38,998
All right.

554
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:43,720
You were uncomfortable with
the lie that we've told.

555
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:45,388
You shouldn't be.
Easy for you to say.

556
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,756
Why? Because I'm
a mere consultant

557
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:48,141
and you're a real
policeman, huh?

558
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:49,792
You think I don't
have as much respect

559
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:51,094
for the captain
as you do?

560
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:53,846
No, of course not.
Huh.

561
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:58,017
I removed the gun from
your apartment for two reasons.

562
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,803
Firstly, I'm absolutely certain
that you didn't shoot

563
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:02,272
Curtis Bradshaw. Why?

564
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:03,773
Because only an idiot
would've brought the gun

565
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,158
back to his apartment
after he'd used it.

566
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,526
And you, Detective,
are not an idiot.

567
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:08,811
Thank you.
Secondly,

568
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:10,997
I don't want to put
our friend, the captain,

569
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,499
in the unenviable position
of having to open a case

570
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,168
against his favored apprentice
and right-hand man.

571
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,503
If he knew this gun
was found in your apartment,

572
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:20,006
he would have no choice
but to inform Internal Affairs.

573
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:22,008
The last thing our investigation
needs right now

574
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,593
is a jaunt around
the bureaucratic maypole,

575
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:24,961
wouldn't you agree?

576
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:26,963
So, what now?

577
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:29,299
I would like to take
a second look at your apartment.

578
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:32,969
Just out of curiosity,
Detective, how many of those

579
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:34,387
do you have--
keys to your apartment?

580
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:35,671
Why do you want to know?

581
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,106
Your framer obviously

582
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:38,524
didn't force their way in,

583
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:41,060
so they either picked the lock
or they have a key.

584
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:42,862
No.

585
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:44,864
You're certain?
Of course.

586
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:47,367
Look, go to my place,
do that thing you do.

587
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,185
I'll keep trying to
think of suspects.

588
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:51,120
If anyone comes to
mind, I'll call you.

589
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:53,356
Mmm.

590
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,129
Andre?

591
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:01,831
Over here.

592
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,050
So what is it you couldn't
say to me over the phone?

593
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:06,052
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Aren't you worried

594
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:08,471
somebody here may
figure out we're family?

595
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,879
I want to talk to you
about Curtis Bradshaw.

596
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:19,899
Nah, see, I'm not allowed to
discuss criminal activity.

597
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:22,986
You were pretty clear
about that last night.

598
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:24,737
Would you please listen?

599
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:27,073
Somebody's trying
to frame me for murder.

600
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:30,159
That drive-by
was just a stunt.

601
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:31,611
Somebody put Bradshaw's
stink on it,

602
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:33,446
trying to fit me
for a motive.

603
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:35,498
Then they killed the man,
and they...

604
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
hid the gun in my house.

605
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:38,901
Are you serious?

606
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:40,203
Oh, we got a few leads.

607
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:42,038
Obviously,
he knows where I live,

608
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,540
had a way to get in
quick, quiet.

609
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:47,677
And we know
he wears Pergotti boots.

610
00:24:48,745 --> 00:24:49,879
Just like the ones

611
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:51,547
that were in
that box of clothes

612
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,750
I gave you
when you first got out.

613
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:56,469
You think it's me.
I didn't say that.

614
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,888
Yeah, you did.
Hey, Andre...

615
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,690
Well, that's why you brought
me down here, right?

616
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:01,974
Just in case you
were right,

617
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:03,393
you could throw me
in a cell somewhere.

618
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:04,560
I mean, it's not
like I could

619
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:06,029
bring a gun up
in here with...

620
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:07,563
Hey, you stayed with me
when you first got out.

621
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,148
You could have made a copy
of my house key.

622
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,150
Then, last night, you said,
maybe someday I would

623
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:12,402
know what it was like to be you?

624
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:14,770
What, and you thought that
meant I would try to...

625
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:17,407
Look, things have been bad

626
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:19,876
between us
for a long time, Andre.

627
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:21,327
No, things have been bad

628
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:23,379
ever since you decided
to become a cop.

629
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:25,882
I should have joined
a gang, like you?

630
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:27,450
Gone out and run a corner?

631
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:29,285
You know, I've sacrificed
everything for you.

632
00:25:29,287 --> 00:25:30,920
You did what came easy to you.

633
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,640
The only thing you ever
sacrificed were years

634
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:37,009
you could have shaved off
your sentence if you had rolled

635
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:38,845
on your friends
when you got arrested.

636
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:42,732
Years you could have
spent with me, with mom.

637
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:46,152
Please, if that was you

638
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:47,570
shot up my car
the other night,

639
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:48,938
if you had anything to do

640
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,323
with what happened
to Curtis Bradshaw,

641
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:52,692
now is the time
to tell me.

642
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:55,661
Now is the time
to let me try and help you.

643
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:59,282
Andre?

644
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,783
Hey.

645
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,835
Andre?

646
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,871
Bell! Bell!

647
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:06,205
Hey, back.

648
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,008
Back! Hey, it's
okay. It's fine.

649
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,660
It's all right.
He's my brother.

650
00:26:13,764 --> 00:26:18,217
Oh, I take it the
bathroom is also a bust.

651
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:19,668
That depends.

652
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,137
Can you think of any reason

653
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:22,855
that Bell would have
a lingerie catalogue

654
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:24,307
in which your head
has been superimposed

655
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,892
on almost all
of the models?

656
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:27,727
He hasn't, but can you think
of any reason he would?

657
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:29,512
Okay, you're just
frustrated because

658
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:30,897
we've been here
for a few hours

659
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,532
and we haven't
found anything.

660
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:34,517
I'm <i>annoyed</i> because
we haven't found anything.

661
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,035
I'm frustrated because,

662
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:38,404
despite the recent attempt
on a colleague's life,

663
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,823
you still haven't agreed
to learn self-defense.

664
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:42,241
You know, I appreciate

665
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:43,993
your concern with my safety,
I really do,

666
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:45,495
but I think we need
to have a conversation

667
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:47,196
about boundaries.

668
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:48,697
Okay, you know, you've given me
this incredible window

669
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,883
into what you do,
and you know what?

670
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:52,885
It is fascinating,
but at the end of the day,

671
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:55,054
I am not your apprentice.
I am your sober companion.

672
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:56,839
No, you're not!
No, you are not.

673
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:59,041
You haven't been
for quite some time.

674
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:00,893
Sherlock, what are you...?
I know that

675
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:02,595
you lied to me
several weeks ago when you said

676
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:04,263
that my father
had renewed your contract.

677
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:06,482
I found out when
I telephoned him last week.

678
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:09,902
I'm not angry.

679
00:27:09,904 --> 00:27:12,438
If anything, I am grateful.

680
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,607
You saw that
I was in a raw state,

681
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:17,910
and you stayed
to see me through it.

682
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,779
Now, when I learned
of the lie, however,

683
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:24,534
I-I deliberately adopted
a more sanguine mood.

684
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:26,669
I wanted you to see
that I was well again

685
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,671
so you could... move on.

686
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,542
But the most curious thing
happened.

687
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:35,127
You stayed.

688
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:38,681
Days passed,
then a week.

689
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:40,600
It became clearer and clearer

690
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:42,718
that you were not
staying for me,

691
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,353
but for yourself.

692
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:46,472
Sherlock, I...

693
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:48,558
It's difficult for you
to say aloud, I know,

694
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,109
so I won't ask you to.

695
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:54,313
Rather, I would ask you
to consider a proposal.

696
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,765
Stay on permanently.

697
00:27:56,767 --> 00:28:00,620
Not as my sober companion,
but as my companion.

698
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:03,456
Allow me to continue
to teach you.

699
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:06,325
Assist me
in my investigations.

700
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:09,161
In return,
you will receive a stipend

701
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:10,713
that will at least equal

702
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:12,999
the salary my father
was paying you.

703
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,918
You don't even have
a source of income.

704
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,804
I have certain funds
set aside.

705
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:22,258
You may continue
to reside at the brownstone,

706
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,810
you may reside elsewhere.

707
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:27,647
You may also consider
yourself relieved

708
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:29,899
of any and all
confidentiality burdens

709
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:32,518
with regards
to my sobriety.

710
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:36,522
See, this is
an important decision,

711
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:39,692
and I encourage you
to discuss it with others.

712
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:44,163
Explain what
you have been to me...

713
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:48,167
and what <i>I</i> believe
you <i>can</i> be to me.

714
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:50,419
Hmm?

715
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:52,988
Partner.

716
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:07,803
Oh, and lest you think
that this is an act

717
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:11,190
of, uh, charity, a gift
from a grateful client,

718
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:14,727
let me assure you,
it is not.

719
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:18,864
I am... better with you, Watson.

720
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:22,451
Um, I'm sharper,
I'm more focused.

721
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:29,325
Difficult to say why, exactly.

722
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:34,997
Perhaps, in time,
I'll solve that, as well.

723
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:47,677
Andre?

724
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,846
Look, I know you're in there.
I can hear the TV.

725
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:55,050
I just... I want to apologize
for what I said before.

726
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:58,104
I never should have called you
down to the station like that.

727
00:29:58,106 --> 00:29:59,488
Can you just... Andre?

728
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,557
Andre, you in here?

729
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,793
...opening fire
with a 12-gauge shotgun...

730
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,111
Andre!

731
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,206
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

732
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:21,043
Hold on. Hold on.

733
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:25,681
Yeah. This is
Detective Marcus Bell,

734
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:28,434
badge number 42819.

735
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:31,220
I need an bus
at 73 Parsons Boulevard.

736
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:33,939
Male shot at the scene.

737
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:38,060
Be advised, the victim...
is my brother.

738
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:42,431
Come here.

739
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:03,592
It's interesting.

740
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,694
We were in Detective
Bell's apartment

741
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:07,629
for four hours this afternoon.

742
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,865
I saw nothing that would
indicate he had a brother.

743
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,533
Well, he did say before
he left for the hospital

744
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,235
that they were not
on the best of terms.

745
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:15,804
Still... I'm me.

746
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:20,258
You've been staring
at that message

747
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,943
for over five minutes now.

748
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:23,111
Have I?

749
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:25,397
I don't think
it's a coded message.

750
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,068
No. No, but it's admirable,
though, isn't it?

751
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,821
I mean, whoever tried
to frame Detective Bell

752
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:34,373
clearly had the same idea here.

753
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,908
I foiled the first
frame-up when I delivered

754
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,443
the nine-millimeter
to the police.

755
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:40,629
I said that I found it, hmm?

756
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,831
They tried a second attempt.

757
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,300
Detective Bell's sibling
lost consciousness,

758
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:48,220
but before he did,
he makes a valiant attempt

759
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:51,089
to make sure that he doesn't end
up a prop in that masquerade.

760
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:52,924
How do you know
it was the same shooter?

761
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:54,409
Andre is an ex-convict.

762
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:57,596
His legal file
is over four inches thick.

763
00:31:57,598 --> 00:31:59,931
Who knows what kind of trouble
he might have been in?

764
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:02,901
Obviously, Andre Bell knew
that he wasn't in any at all.

765
00:32:02,903 --> 00:32:05,470
Why else would he use what
might have been his last breath

766
00:32:05,472 --> 00:32:07,239
to try and clear his brother?

767
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:09,491
He understood what this was.

768
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:12,811
Look.

769
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:21,536
You see the slight declivity
in the dirt?

770
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:26,124
If that's not another
partial Pergotti footprint

771
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:28,126
meant to implicate
Detective Bell,

772
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:29,711
I'll stop throwing
tennis balls at you.

773
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:31,680
You can tell what that is
all the way from here?

774
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:34,716
Don't you think
it's time for us

775
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:36,635
to tell Captain Gregson
about the framer?

776
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:39,471
I think I would like to discuss
it with the detective first.

777
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:41,807
I obviously put
certain wheels in motion

778
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:44,443
when I removed the handgun
from his apartment.

779
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:46,695
I don't want to make another
move without his consent.

780
00:32:48,448 --> 00:32:49,731
<i>I'll tell him.</i>

781
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:50,982
You were
just trying

782
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:52,734
to help me out,
and him.

783
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,319
He'll understand, but...

784
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,821
but I think he'll
take it better

785
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:58,156
coming from me.

786
00:32:58,158 --> 00:32:59,825
Look, this
isn't right.

787
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:01,660
They said they were
gonna close him up

788
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:03,528
20 minutes ago.

789
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,863
It takes time.

790
00:33:04,865 --> 00:33:07,048
It's a good sign
they decided to suture.

791
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:11,052
You saved his life.

792
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:13,088
If anyone could take

793
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,206
two slugs to the back
and pull through,

794
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,709
it's Andre.

795
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,644
He's a stubborn bastard.

796
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:21,313
Today that is a good thing.

797
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:23,748
About time it started
working for him--

798
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,083
ruined the last three years

799
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:27,051
of his life.
What do you mean?

800
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:29,354
Nothing. I just...

801
00:33:29,356 --> 00:33:33,024
never quite forgave him for
staying in as long as he did.

802
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:35,861
A while back,
I cashed in a big favor

803
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:38,196
to get him
an early parole hearing.

804
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:40,398
But the dope...

805
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,434
he wouldn't
play ball.

806
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:45,504
All he had to do was identify
his gang's drug hookup.

807
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:48,206
Mind you, the police already
knew who the guy was.

808
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,709
He was serving
ten to 20.

809
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:52,644
But Andre has his code.

810
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:55,797
He wouldn't talk;
served his full term.

811
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,518
It was you.

812
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,087
You were the one
who blew the whistle

813
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:03,939
on the Curtis Bradshaw detail.

814
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,640
What?

815
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:08,927
I looked at some
of Andre's files tonight.

816
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,947
<i>His first parole hearing</i>
<i>was June 2009,</i>

817
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,065
one month after Mickey Hudson

818
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,901
was busted
for planting evidence.

819
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:17,652
I don't know what
you're talking about.

820
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:19,471
It fits.

821
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:21,439
Your place is immaculate.

822
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:23,241
Your sock drawer
is immaculate.

823
00:34:23,243 --> 00:34:25,176
You're a straight shooter
in every corner of your life,

824
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:27,462
and your frustration with Andre
because he wouldn't talk...

825
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:28,947
I don't see why it matters.

826
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,949
It matters, Detective.
Did you earn the favor

827
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:33,084
by informing
on your boss or not?

828
00:34:33,086 --> 00:34:36,171
I wasn't gonna watch
some dirtbag plant evidence.

829
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:38,223
That wasn't right.
Someone had to speak up.

830
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:40,559
So what?
So what?

831
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,627
We've been looking
at the wrong pool of suspects.

832
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:45,597
Anyone from the old detail would
have had the requisite skills

833
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,966
and the motive
to carry out these crimes.

834
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:49,484
They'd want to see you punished.

835
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:50,602
Nobody knew.

836
00:34:50,604 --> 00:34:52,520
Perhaps they found out.

837
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:58,142
You wanted
to see me, Captain?

838
00:34:58,144 --> 00:35:00,144
Have a seat,
Officer Reyes.

839
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:14,459
Did I do something wrong?
Oh, we have reason

840
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:17,012
to believe you did
several things wrong.

841
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,798
Shooting up
Detective Bell's car,

842
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,349
for example.

843
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:23,768
Killing Curtis Bradshaw.

844
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,504
Planting the murder weapon
in Bell's residence.

845
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:29,641
Shooting his brother when the
first frame-up went sideways.

846
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:32,394
Wha... what?

847
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,480
We recently had occasion
to take a very careful look

848
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:38,733
at the members of the Curtis
Bradshaw detail who worked

849
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:39,985
<i>with Detective Mickey Hudson</i>

850
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:42,871
in 2009, and there you were.

851
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:44,739
Yeah, and?

852
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:47,325
Well, you looked up to Hudson,
you respected him.

853
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:49,027
He wrote you a recommendation
when you applied

854
00:35:49,029 --> 00:35:50,378
for promotion to the vice squad.

855
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,163
Yeah, he was good police.

856
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,999
Well, there are some members
of Internal Affairs

857
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,000
who would disagree with you.

858
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:56,251
The rat squad?

859
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,303
I never much cared
what they thought.

860
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:01,056
Well, Detective Evan Carlyle,

861
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,924
of the rat squad,

862
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:05,209
would be most disappointed
to hear you say that.

863
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:07,178
We know that you've been
seeing him on and off

864
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,379
for the past few months.

865
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:10,015
And we strongly suspect

866
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:12,383
it had something to
with gaining access to his most

867
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:13,685
sensitive files.

868
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:15,820
Three years ago, when I.A. first

869
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,522
started to investigate Hudson,

870
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:20,058
they came to suspect that maybe
you had helped him steal

871
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,078
the drugs that wended their way
into Curtis Bradshaw's home.

872
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,897
Yeah, they questioned me.

873
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:28,616
I told them I had
nothing to do with it.

874
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:30,835
And Hudson backed
your story, probably

875
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:33,404
because he'd already
decided to kill himself.

876
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:35,573
Why's he gonna ruin your life

877
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:37,459
when he'd already decided
to end his own?

878
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,262
But you still had
a black mark against you.

879
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:43,298
Department couldn't take
any real action against you,

880
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,352
but you were told
vice was never gonna happen.

881
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:48,937
You were undeterred.

882
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,138
You applied three more times.

883
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,923
After your most
recent rejection,

884
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:52,941
I imagine you were incensed.

885
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:55,060
You simply
had to know--

886
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:58,730
who was it who tipped off I.A.
as to Hudson's transgressions?

887
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:00,732
Must have broken your heart
when you found out

888
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:02,617
that it was Detective Bell.

889
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,486
Someone you had dated.

890
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,571
Someone who'd given you
the key to his apartment.

891
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,406
He must've known--
he made no mention

892
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:10,075
of your name when
he filed his report.

893
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,043
He had absolutely no clue
as to your involvement.

894
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:14,796
When we told him
a short while ago-- stunned.

895
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:18,750
You have a problem

896
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:19,801
with me, Captain?

897
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,953
Take it up with my union rep.

898
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:24,122
So, we visited your
home this morning.

899
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:27,559
Um, would you care

900
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:31,012
to explain these?

901
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,598
Shoelace eyelets.

902
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,483
From a pair of Pergotti boots.

903
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:37,102
The same boots you used

904
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:39,020
<i>to plant footprints</i>
<i>that you knew would lead back</i>

905
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:41,139
to Detective Bell.

906
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:42,857
You torched them in your garage,
but those didn't burn.

907
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,360
Does the name Denny Vargas
mean anything to you?

908
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:48,646
Should do-- you arrested
him two months ago

909
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:50,031
in his home.

910
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,916
It was suspected
that Vargas was maintaining

911
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:54,869
an arsenal of untraceable,
unregistered firearms.

912
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:58,173
Strangely none of those
firearms were seized

913
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,491
by you during the arrest.

914
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:03,094
Well, not officially anyway.

915
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:05,597
The assault on
Detective Bell's car was done

916
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,048
with a modified MP5.

917
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,552
Bradshaw was killed
with a Colt nine-millimeter.

918
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,886
And Andre Bell was shot

919
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:14,005
<i>with an as yet undiscovered</i>

920
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:15,390
.22 caliber pistol.

921
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:18,059
The lab ran tests,
and the bullet profiles

922
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:21,529
for these attacks match
several of the crimes

923
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:23,798
committed by Denny Vargas.

924
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,650
It's interesting, no?

925
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:29,495
You arrest him,
his guns disappear.

926
00:38:29,496 --> 00:38:32,330
Could it be, Officer Reyes,

927
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:34,649
that you are stockpiling
your own personal armory

928
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:37,952
of untraceable guns?

929
00:38:47,012 --> 00:38:49,497
Oh, why am I not surprised
he's not here?

930
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,967
Bell.

931
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:56,521
He would never say anything
like this to my face.

932
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:02,477
It's not his style.

933
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,395
Officer Paula Reyes
was arrested this morning...

934
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:07,181
So even if she pleads out,

935
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:11,119
that'll be life, right?

936
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:13,488
Probably.

937
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:21,463
You remember Sharise?

938
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:23,164
Mm-hmm.

939
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,116
She cut the spokes
on my bike

940
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:28,119
when we broke up
in the seventh grade.

941
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:31,973
But that's the worst thing any
of my exes tried to do to me.

942
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:41,566
Andre, about what
I said the other day,

943
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,851
asking you if you, uh...

944
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:44,185
Don't.

945
00:39:44,187 --> 00:39:45,487
You don't have
to say anything.

946
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:47,071
No, I do.

947
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:49,073
I do. I'm sorry.

948
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:52,193
I, uh...

949
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:54,929
It's cool, Marcus.

950
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:57,248
It's cool, seriously.

951
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:00,568
I-I got to ask.

952
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,620
The note you left?

953
00:40:02,622 --> 00:40:04,405
"Was not Marcus"?

954
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:07,175
You told me someone tried

955
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:08,459
to frame you for a shooting.

956
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:10,428
I-I don't know.

957
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,713
I just figured maybe

958
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:13,031
it was the same guy.

959
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:15,183
No, I know, but...

960
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:17,919
we-we fought yesterday.

961
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:19,587
You were shot in the back.

962
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:21,306
No way you saw who did it.

963
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:23,608
No way you could've known
for sure it wasn't me.

964
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,727
But I did know.

965
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:28,446
I know you.

966
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:34,035
And you got to look out
for family.

967
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:36,821
Even when they disappoint you.

968
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:45,112
You're rearranging
the locks again.

969
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:51,786
You're doing it by...

970
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:54,088
date of manufacture,

971
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,790
earliest to latest.
Yep.

972
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:58,927
Seems like the most sensible
way to display them.

973
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:00,311
This week anyway.

974
00:41:04,817 --> 00:41:06,484
I like to be paid
on Thursdays.

975
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:10,154
And since I don't
have an apartment

976
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:11,823
right now, I will
stay here rent-free

977
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:12,941
until I find something else.

978
00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:14,325
And you will
continue going

979
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:15,610
to group support
meetings with me

980
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:17,829
for as long
as we work together.

981
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:23,785
Congratulations
on your new career, Watson.

982
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,610
Just one more thing
for this to work.

983
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:35,209
Yes, what's that?

984
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,694
Ow!

985
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:39,080
Could have been a knife.

986
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:44,082
