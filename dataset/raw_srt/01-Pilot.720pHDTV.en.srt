I'm already at his house

I've been hired

to be your sober companion.

38
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:24,109

to e-mail you about me.

I'm here to make the transition

00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,928
from your rehab
experience

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,264

Um...
I know what you're thinking:

46
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,210
the world is a cynical place,
and I must be a cynical man,

47
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,579
thinking a woman like you
would fall for a line like that.

66
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:30,992
Mr. Holmes,

67
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:33,061
did your father tell you
about me or not?

68
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:37,115
Uh, he e-mailed, said to expect
some sort of addict-sitter.

69
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,667
Well, then he
explained his conditions

70
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,118
with respect to your sobriety?

71
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,254
Well, if you mean his threats
to evict me from this,

72
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,714
the shoddiest and the least
renovated of the five--

73
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,741
count them, five--

74
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,426
properties he owns in New York,
then yeah, he made his conditions

75
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,846
quite clear.

76
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,932
I refuse your,
quote-unquote, "help,"

77
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,416
I wind up on the street.

78
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:57,769
It's my understanding
that most sober companions

79
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,354
are recovering addicts
themselves, but...

80
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:01,940
you've never had a problem
with drugs or alcohol.

81
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,608
Your father told you.

82
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,059
Of course he didn't.

83
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,062
Uh, would you care to explain
why you broke out

84
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,231
of your rehab facility the same
day you were being released?

85
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,632
Bored.

86
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,683
You were bored?

87
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,834
No, I am bored right now.

88
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,319
It happens often;
you'll get used to it.

89
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,737
Regarding
our mutual friends

90
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,540
at Hemdale, I'd say
they should be thanking me

91
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:19,808
for exposing the flaws

92
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,109
in their rubbish security
system, wouldn't you?

93
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,277
(sniffs)
Excellent.

94
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,913
There was a woman leaving
just as I got here.

95
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:26,781
Did she get you high?

96
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,850
Actually, about six feet.

97
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,036
I actually find
sex repellent.

98
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,021
All those fluids
and all the sounds,

99
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,089
but my brain
and my body

100
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:36,241
require it to function
at optimum levels,

101
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,276
so I feed them as needed.

102
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,961
You're a doctor;
you understand.

103
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,880
Uh, I'm not doctor.

104
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,416
Were a doctor-- a surgeon,
judging by your hands.

105
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,901
Is your car
parked nearby?

106
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:48,203
Uh, yes, it's just outsi...

107
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,255
How did you know I had a car?

108
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,924
Parking ticket-- fell out of
your purse when you dropped it.

109
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,875
Can't have one

110
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,777
without the
other, can you?

111
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,779
We're late.
We need to get going.

112
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,031
Uh, late for what?

113
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,132
Actually, scratch the car.

114
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,934
Manhattan Bridge is
down to a single lane.

115
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,502
We'll take the
tube instead.

116
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,837
Look at this place. Yuck.

117
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,356
Can't wait for you to tidy it.

118
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,310
Prior to my stint
in junkie jail,

119
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,529
I worked as a consultant
at Scotland Yard.

120
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,432
Your father told me--
he said you were a detective?

121
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:20,118
I was a consultant.
I wasn't paid for my services,

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,921
and therefore I answered
to no one but myself.

123
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:26,725

124

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,013
WATSON:
What about London?

126
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,381
What about it?

127
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,033
He told me that's
where you bottomed out.

128
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,151
He thinks something happened

129
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:37,552
to you there--
he just doesn't know what.

130
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,354
Handsome woman, your mother.

131
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,890
It's very big of her to take
your dad back after the affair.

132
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:44,359
How could you possibly...?

133
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,929
You still haven't told me
where we're going yet.

134
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,516
About that, I think you and
Father will be pleased to hear

135
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,885
I have devised a post-rehab
regimen for myself

136
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,487
that'll keep me quite busy.

137
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,556
I decided to resume my
work as a consultant here...

138
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,692

Tell me, how do clients
typically introduce you?

143
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:22,021
What do you mean?

144
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:24,406
I-I mean I find it hard to believe
they'd actually tell someone

145
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,225
they've been assigned a
glorified helper monkey.

146
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:28,443
Helper monkey?
Well, you and I have

147
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:30,179
what's known as companion/client
confidentiality,

148
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,664
which means that you can
introduce me however you like.

149
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,800
Friend, coworker, relative,
and I'll play along.

150
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:37,586
But to be honest,
most clients just call me

151
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,021
their companion.

152
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,172

She waits out here.
I'm afraid she's

160
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,702
quite crucial to
my process, Captain.

161

It's okay, really.

162

Actually, it isn't.

163

the job of a proper valet

165
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:04,279
to accompany his or her charge
to their place of business.

166
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,465
Well, consider this
my place of business.

167
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,800
Consider every wretched hive
of depravity and murder

168
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:10,952
in this city my
place of business.

169
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:13,128
Unless, of course, you
don't think you have

170
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:14,790
the stomach for the work I do.

171
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,308
I'm good.

172
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,895
Could you put
these gloves on, please?

173
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,349
Dr. Richard Mantlo
came home a few hours ago

174
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:27,319
to find his door kicked in
and his wife...

175
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,521
Amy Dampier, missing.

176
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,473
That's, uh...

177
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,442
that's Mantlo over there.

178
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,811
He's a headshrinker out
at Sanbridge Hospital.

179
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:37,446
Says he caught an emergency
last night,

180
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,147
didn't get home till 5:00 a.m.

181
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,166
Saw the front door,

182
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,268
called 911.

183
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,755
First officers on the scene
found signs of-of a struggle

184
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,190
in the kitchen

185
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,508
and in the master bedroom.

186
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,077
But no Ms. Dampier.

187
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,178
Ransom demand?

188
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,180
Hm.

189
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,306
GREGSON:
What is it?

190
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,275
I'm not sure.

191
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,248
Ms. Dampier's cell phone,
have you recovered it?

192
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,716
We have her cell phone?

193
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:17,119
Thank you, Detective.

194
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,139
Hm.

195
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:29,898
Hm.

196
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,267
She either lost a tremendous
amount of weight or underwent

197
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,920
significant plastic surgery
sometime in the last two years.

198
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:37,756
WATSON: She looks the same
in all the photos.

199
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,157
That's my point.

200
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,409
Ovular frames...

201
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:41,743
are older, have
been here longer

202
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:42,794
You can tell by the way

203
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:45,047
the wall has faded--
square frames newer.

204
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,215
They're the only ones
that feature Ms. Dampier.

205
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:48,634
Coincidence? No.

206
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:50,085
Check her cell phone.

207
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,321
No photos of her
older than two years.

208
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,323
Yet there are countless
pictures of other people

209
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,875
in her life,
as many as five years ago.

210
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,515
WATSON: I take it you two have
worked together before?

211
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:04,883
Yeah, ten years ago.

212
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,970
A few months after 9/11
I was assigned to Scotland Yard

213
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:10,389
(sniffing) to observe their
counterterrorism bureau.

214
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:13,625
Holmes mostly worked
homicides, but, uh...

215
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,845
...our paths still
crossed a few times.

216
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:28,190
Captain, if you please?

217
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,441
Yeah?

218
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,043
Ms. Dampier knew
her attacker.

219
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,544
She let him
into the house herself.

220
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:34,262
(chuckles)
Captain,

221
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:35,180
who-who is this guy?

222
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:36,531
There are two
broken glasses here.

223
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,500
HOLMES: You can tell from
the volume of shards.

224
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:41,069
Obviously, she was pouring
a glass of water for her guest

225
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,020
when he assailed her.

226
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,755
Right. Is that something
you would do

227
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:46,158
if some nut job comes in
and kicks your door in,

228
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,094
you ask him
if he's thirsty.

229
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,380
Could I...?

230
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,564
Thank you.

231
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:02,657
Base of glass number... two.

232
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:06,411
If you take another glance

233
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:08,930
at the boot print
on the front door,

234
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:11,333
you will see an almost
imperceptible spot of blood

235
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:13,402
where the heel made contact.
Lab tests, I'm certain,

236
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,138
will conclude it's the victim's blood,
and could only have been

237
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,024
left there after the assault
had already taken place.

238
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,759
Ms. Dampier

239
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,361
let the man in
because he was

240
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:23,395
familiar to her.

241
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,380
He kicked the door in
as he exited

242
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:27,049
to try to obscure this fact.

243
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,334
Also, he took something
from the living room.

244
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,710
Note the symmetry
of the space, hm?

245
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:41,630
This wall is very nearly
a reflection of that one.

246
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,632
Pictures, pictures,
knickknacks, knickknacks.

247
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:46,935
I see balance everywhere,
except...

248
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,637
this one space.

249
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,656
Hey, something was
here-- what was it?

250
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,226
I'm sorry?
Maybe this isn't the best time.

251
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:55,560
No, no, please
concentrate.

252
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:56,978
Something used
to occupy that space.

253
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,997
I need you to tell me
what it was.

254
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,665
MANTLO:
Uh, it was an old...

255
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:04,619
ring box-- Amy's grandmother
gave it to her. Why?

256
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,988
You said there were also signs
of struggle

257
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,190
in the master bedroom?

258
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,342
Mm-hmm.

259
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,700
What is it?

260
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,852
Why is it so important that
the kidnapper took a ring box?

261
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,737
Kidnappers don't
take trophies. Killers do.

262
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:24,172
OFFICER:
There's no body, genius.

263
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:26,491
There's no blood on
the front stoop or walk, either.

264
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,210
It's rather difficult
not to leave any

265
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,344
when you're abducting someone

266
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:30,846
with an arterial wound,
wouldn't you agree?

267
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:32,247
You're certain
your men have been

268
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:33,548
over every inch
of this house?

269
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,750
Of course.

270
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:41,789
But as you can see,
there was a struggle here.

271
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:57,806
She's in the safe room.

272
00:11:57,808 --> 00:11:59,207
What safe room?

273
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,126
The one behind that wall.

274
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:03,378
Husband didn't say anything
about any safe room.

275
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,964
There's a slight angle to the
floor in here. You can't f...

276
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:08,483
It's...

277
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:09,968
The extra weight

278
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,452
of the safe room
steel reinforcements

279
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:14,089
can cause the floor
around it to decline slightly,

280
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:16,508
creating a slope between

281
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,960
one and five degrees.

282
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,980
(metallic creak,
clacking)

283
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,056
(Watson gasps)

284
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:36,478
Sometimes I hate it
when I'm right.

285
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,850
(sighs) For the last time,
I loved my wife.

286
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:50,374
I didn't hurt her,
and before this moment,

287
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:52,843
I had no idea there was
any safe room in my house.

288
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:55,930
You get why that's hard
for us to believe, don't you?

289
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:59,350
The place was gutted before Amy
and I moved in two years ago.

290
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,569
She oversaw
all the construction.

291
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,187
I'm sorry,
but, uh, are you saying

292
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,306
she had it installed,
but never told you?

293
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,792
How do you do it?

294
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,244
Do what?

295
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:11,879
Guess things.

296
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:14,181
I don't guess. I observe.

297
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:17,301
And once I've observed,
I deduce.

298
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:18,769
You said you could
tell from my hands

299
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,170
that I used to
be a surgeon.

300
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,740
"Hand"-- singular, actually.

301
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,508
It was soft, no calluses.

302
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,895
Also, it smelled
faintly of beeswax.

303
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:32,316
Oh, many surgeons, as you know,

304
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:34,718
use a beeswax cream
to protect their hands

305
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,904
from the dehydrating effects
of repeated washings. Well...

306
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,189
You're no longer practicing,
but old habits die hard.

307
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,592
As far as why you gave up
your medical career

308
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:43,377
to become a companion--

309
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,129
I'd wager that addiction
claimed the life

310
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,465
of someone close to you,
and his or her death moved you

311
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,834
to make drastic changes
in your life.

312
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,269
Am I close?

313
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,888
What about my father?

314
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,205
What about him?

315
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,775
How did you know
he had an affair?

316
00:13:57,777 --> 00:13:59,326
Google.

317
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:02,563
Well, not everything
is deducible.

318
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,932
(door opening)

319
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:09,103
I, uh, just want to say thanks
for helping out today.

320
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:12,856
You-you got us our guy in,
and, uh... and we're grateful.

321
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,625
We can take it from here.

322
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:16,877
Respectfully, Detective,
I doubt that very much,

323
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,479
'cause I have
reason to believe

324
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,614
that Richard Mantlo
didn't kill his wife.

325
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:22,483
Wait, wait, wait.

326
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:23,567
Wait, wait.

327
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:24,919
Come again?

328
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:26,720
Dr. Mantlo has girls' feet,
or hadn't you noticed?

329
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,289
He's a size eight
if he's an inch.

330
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,174
The boot print on his
front door was an 11.

331
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,342
So? So he was smart.

332
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:32,927
He wore bigger shoes
to throw us off.

333
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:35,312
Did he also wear bigger hands
when he strangled his wife?

334
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:36,447
Holmes...

335
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:37,598
Well, these strangulation
marks are indicative

336
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,833
of a man much
larger than Mantlo.

337
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:40,868
No just heavier,
but-but taller.

338
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,236
I'd estimate his height

339
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:44,388
to be somewhere between
six foot-one, six foot-three.

340
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,274
Your M.E. will come to the same
conclusion in a couple of hours.

341
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,692
I'm delivering it now.
You're a doctor.

342
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,527
Tell 'em I'm right.
I'm not a doctor.

343
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,845
<i>Were</i> a doctor.

344
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,632
Surely you haven't forgotten
how bruising works.

345
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:58,636
Okay, yeah, sure, these hands
do seem a little small for the

346
00:14:58,638 --> 00:14:59,364
bruise pattern, but I...

347
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:01,389
With your permission,
Captain, I'd like a moment

348
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,773
alone with Dr. Mantlo.
Captain, this...

349
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,241
You got two minutes.

350
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:11,065
Tall men in your life--
I'd like a list.

351
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,351
(siren blaring)

352
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,486
Amy was a good person,
but if you're here

353
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,839
because you think I had
something to do with it...

354
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:21,358
Dr. Mantlo said
that you'd made a pass at her

355
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,826
at a holiday party last year.

356
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,928
Actually, no,
I didn't.

357
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,748
I asked her about all
the plastic surgery she'd had.

358
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,183
Plastic surgery?

359
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:31,885
Okay, look, I helped
plan a fund-raiser

360
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,571
for the hospital, two years ago,
that was before the surgeries.

361
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:36,306
I know I still
have the pictures.

362
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:39,176
(beep, then
indistinct voice over P.A.)

363
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,633
There.

364
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,988
That's a picture of
Amy and Dr. Mantlo

365
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,408
that I took that night, okay?
Tell me you wouldn't want

366
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,559
to ask her why she did it.

367
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:56,960
Tell me about the
stalking charge

368
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:58,445
brought against
you two years ago.

369
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,581
I asked my neighbor out.

370
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,083
She overreacted.

371
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:05,269
Hmm.
Mr. Polk, can you tell us

372
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,603
where you were last night?

373
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,439
POLK:
Home... alone.

374
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:09,823
I know.

375
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:12,126
Not much of an alibi,
but I don't care,

376
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,344
because I didn't do it.

377
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,533
(door creaks open)

378
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:40,904
Um, did you know

379
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:43,340
that honey was dripping
through the ceiling?

380
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:44,808
Yes. Happens sometimes.

381
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,595
I take it beekeeping is a hobby.

382
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:50,714
(buzzing)
I'm writing a book.

383
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,716
<i>Practical Handbook</i>
<i>of Bee Culture</i>

384
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:54,985
<i>with Some Observations Upon</i>
<i>the Segregation of the Queen.</i>

385
00:16:56,104 --> 00:16:58,422
Up here. I've just started
Chapter 19.

386
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,791
Would you like to hear
the last few paragraphs?

387
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:04,161
Did you talk to the police about
that scary administrator guy?

388
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:05,996
I have not.
But I thought that...

389
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:07,431
Mr. Polk is a prat, no doubt,

390
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:08,732
but his body language

391
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,868
said "sub," not "dom."

392
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,037
I don't see him having the
berries to take another life.

393
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,709
Why do you suppose
you hate your job so much?

394
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,060
I don't hate my job.

395
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:21,478
You have two
alarm clocks.

396
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,097
No one with two alarm clocks
loves their job.

397
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,565
Two alarm clocks means
it's a chore

398
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,316
for you
to get up in the morning.

399
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,887
You don't hate
what I do, though.

400
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,656
That much was obvious
when we talked to Mr. Polk.

401
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:34,975
There was a look

402
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,210
on your face.

403
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:39,146
I imagine it was the same look
you wore to the O.R.

404
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,614
when you were still a surgeon.

405
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,666
You're wrong.

406
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:45,469
I know my father secured
your services

407
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,055
for the next six weeks?

408
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,242
The simple truth is,
I don't need you.

409
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:54,194
I'm finished with drugs.

410
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,029
I won't be using them again.

411
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,283
My advice?

412
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,585
Take a six-week holiday.

413
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:04,888
I promise I won't tell Papa.

414
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:35,118
(sighs)

415
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,776
I'm gonna need your saliva now.

416
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:45,629
10:37.

417
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,848
I take back everything
I said last night.

418
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,483
You obviously
love your job.

419
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:52,269
Couldn't wait to get
started this morning.

420
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,792
Open you mouth
so I can swab it.

421
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:02,079
If you're on anything, the strip
on the cup will turn blue.

422
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:03,580
I have a...

423
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:05,682
I have a new theory
about our killer.

424
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:08,635
I think he may have struck
at least once before.

425
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:12,422
I-- who love what I do-- woke up
early and couldn't stop thinking

426
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:14,658
about the ring box he stole
from Amy Dampier's living room.

427
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,843
You said
it was some sort of trophy.

428
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:18,095
And you know what flavor

429
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:19,913
of killers takes
trophies, don't you?

430
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:21,748
Serial. Souvenirs help them
differentiate between victims.

431
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,434
It occurred to me that if Amy
wasn't our killer's first,

432
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:26,570
though, there might be
other cases in common.

433
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:29,456
Eileen Renfro.

434
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,925
Savagely beaten and
strangled by an intruder

435
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,677
in her Bronx home
two years ago.

436
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,862
He took a jewelry
box on his way out,

437
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:38,081
but left behind a
size 11 footprint.

438
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,167
Drug free. Congratulations.

439
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,119
Especially striking--
the physical similarities

440
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:43,420
between her and Amy.

441
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:46,540
Both were curvaceous
with long red hair.

442
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:49,059
You think the killer has a type?

443
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:51,194
The one significant difference
in the cases--

444
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:54,731
Eileen Renfro survived
her attack.

445
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:59,002
I'm sorry.

446
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:02,122
I can see why you think
it might be the same guy.

447
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,224
I just don't think I can help you.
HOLMES: We know from the police report

448
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,593
that the man who assaulted you
wore a mask.

449
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:08,929
That doesn't mean
you can't help us identify him.

450
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,547
Did he say anything to you?

451
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,699
No.

452
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:16,436
I came in through my front door,
and he was just... there.

453
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,938
Did he have a particular scent?

454
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,223
Uh... I don't think so.

455
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:21,358
Was he tall, short,
somewhere in between?

456
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,926
I don't know.
I mean,

457
00:20:22,928 --> 00:20:25,045
he was on top
of me so quickly,

458
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:26,496
his hands were around my throat.

459
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:27,931
And what about the mask?

460
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,066
What about it?

461
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:32,319
Was it ski, Mexican wrestling,
paper plate?

462
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,520
Ski.

463
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,322
Good. Excellent.

464
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:37,224
So, you got a good look

465
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:38,542
at his eyes.

466
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,677
Oh, correct me if I'm wrong,
but a-a strangler can,

467
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,479
literally, not be more than
an arm's length

468
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:44,247
from his stranglee, can he? That's what? Two?
Mr. Holmes?

469
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,600
Two and a half feet? I'm twice
that distance from you now.

470
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:48,635
I can see that your eyes
are a lovely brown.

471
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:50,904
I think I'd like you
to leave now.

472
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:52,622
Why? 'Cause I know
that you're lying?

473
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:53,840
Mr. Holmes!
No. She is.

474
00:20:53,842 --> 00:20:55,625
You can tell by the crucifix.
You fiddle with it

475
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:56,827
every time I ask you a question.

476
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,095
It's-it's pacifying behavior.

477
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:00,013
It's just elementary
haptic communication.

478
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:01,481
Just read a book, would you?

479
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,700
She did see her attacker's face.
Sherlock!

480
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:05,185
I think she might even know
who he is!

481
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:06,887
Get out.
You realize

482
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,188
that because you protected him
two years ago,

483
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,573
you have the blood
of an innocent woman

484
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:11,675
on your hands, don't you?
Perhaps you'd like

485
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:13,126
to go for two or three or four.

486
00:21:13,128 --> 00:21:15,712
That's enough!

487
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,814
You're done here.
Go wait in the car.

488
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:26,023
What a jerk!

489
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:30,961
I'm... I'm really sorry
about that.

490
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:41,238
The name of the man who
attacked her is Peter Saldua.

491
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,440
He was her brother's
best friend growing up.

492
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,042
His father was abusive,
so her parents took him in

493
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:46,243
his senior year
of high school.

494
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:48,161
Eileen heard from her
brother that he works

495
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:50,497
for a florist in Chelsea.

496
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:55,168
I knew it.

497
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,487
I knew that if I started
a row in there,

498
00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:00,173
you'd come to her defense,
and if you came to her defense,

499
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:02,759
she might very well
tell you the truth.

500
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:06,996
You are so full of it.

501
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:09,466
(phone beeps, line rings)

502
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:10,851
This is Gregson.

503
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:12,502
Captain Gregson,
Sherlock Holmes.

504
00:22:12,504 --> 00:22:14,271
I'm calling because I believe
I've uncovered

505
00:22:14,273 --> 00:22:16,056
the name of a strong suspect

506
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:18,542
in the murder of Amy Dampier.

507
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:21,845
Name wouldn't be Peter Saldua
by any chance, would it?

508
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:23,847
How did you know?

509
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:24,998
'Cause I'm at his house

510
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,734
and I'm looking at him
right now.

511
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:30,337
Are you saying he's
in police custody?

512
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:32,038
Technically, yeah.

513
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,573
He's all ours.

514
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:45,808
Mailman saw the body
through the window.

515
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:48,054
Calls 911,

516
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:50,890
said he thought someone
on his route had killed himself.

517
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,476
Turns out
he was right.

518
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:54,978
The gun was still
in Saldua's hand

519
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,179
when we got here.

520
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:58,698
Watch the blood spatter.

521
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,617
We found the ring box

522
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,635
from Amy Dampier's
home, right here.

523
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:06,956
Turns out Mantlo
and his wife

524
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,425
used the florist
Saldua worked for.

525
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:11,027
They order fresh flowers
to the house once a week.

526
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:12,695
Saldua was the guy
who delivered them.

527
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:16,366
Explains why she would
have let him the other night.

528
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:18,334
What happened over there?

529
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:19,986
ABREU: Mixed his colors
with his whites?

530
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:21,087
Who knows.

531
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:23,189
Guy was a nut bar.

532
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,676
Did you already
take his phone?

533
00:23:26,678 --> 00:23:28,178
It hasn't turned up yet,

534
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,396
but it will.

535
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:53,369
You wanted to
be the one

536
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:55,205
who found him,
didn't you?

537
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:01,227
I don't do what I do
for the credit.

538
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:04,113
Then why do you
do it?

539
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:11,604
MANTLO:
<i>I would like to thank</i>

540
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:13,323
the police, again,

541
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:15,058
for finding the man
who killed my wife.

542
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,761
I would've liked to seen him
stand trial for what he did...

543
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:21,163
She had her mole removed

544
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:23,166
when she changed her look.

545
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:26,719
It doesn't make any sense.

546
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:28,471
She loved that mole.

547
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:31,491
Before her surgery she turned
her head to feature it

548
00:24:31,493 --> 00:24:32,759
whenever her picture was taken.

549
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:33,810
Where'd you
get those photographs?

550
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:34,978
I reached out

551
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,080
to Amy's friends via
her Facebook page.

552
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:38,398
Harrison Polk was right.

553
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,300
She was as beautiful
before her surgery

554
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:42,919
as she was after, so...

555
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,821
why bother?
What was the point?

556
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:48,324
Another thing.
Saldua's phone records

557
00:24:48,326 --> 00:24:50,693
indicate he used his
cell phone constantly.

558
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:52,228
And yet, three days ago,

559
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,197
he just stopped.
Didn't make a single call.

560
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,731
Didn't send a single text.
Why?

561
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,617
His bank statements meanwhile,

562
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:00,286
there's several checks made out
to Dr. Roland Jessup,

563
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:01,621
Psychologist. He seems
worth a talking to, no? No?

564
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:06,125
No, 'cause he dropped
dead of a coronary, 2010.

565
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:08,181
The Amy Dampier case is over.
You helped solve it.

566
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,213
No.

567
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:11,130
Something's off.
I can feel it.

568
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:12,682
(printer whirrs)

569
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:13,967
What's that?

570
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,019
I got us tickets
to the opera tonight.

571
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,353
Celebrate.

572
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:20,256
When your father hired me,
he mentioned

573
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:21,924
something about
you liking it, so I thought--

574
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:23,526
I went to Le Grande Macabre

575
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:26,446
once, when I was nine,
now I'm a buff.

576
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:29,315
(sighs)
I'm worried about you.

577
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:30,867
I think you're making
things more complicated

578
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:31,985
than they really are,

579
00:25:31,987 --> 00:25:33,736
and it tells me
that you're struggling.

580
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:35,154
No struggle with anything.

581
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:37,323
Or haven't you been paying
attention the last few days?

582
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:38,941
I've been right
about everything.

583
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:39,909
Actually, you haven't.

584
00:25:39,911 --> 00:25:41,878
The day we met
you deduced

585
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,446
that I gave up being a surgeon

586
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:46,633
to become a companion because I
had lost someone close to me.

587
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:47,917
The truth is...

588
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,636
The truth is that you
made a mistake

589
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:52,955
during a surgery that cost
a patient his life.

590
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:55,258
It takes years
of study

591
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,394
to become a surgeon,
not to mention tremendous ego.

592
00:25:58,396 --> 00:25:59,979
Surgeons don't just leave
to become addict-sitters.

593
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:02,148
They're forced out.
And they're only forced out

594
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,434
if they commit
the sin of malpractice.

595
00:26:04,436 --> 00:26:06,436
I knew it would be
a sore subject so I made up

596
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:09,772
the bit about your friend
to spare your feelings.

597
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:14,193
That was very big of you.

598
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:16,913
How do you know
the patient died?

599
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:19,082
How do you know

600
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:21,084
I didn't just leave him
paralyzed or in a coma?

601
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:23,202
The parking ticket!
The one you had in your purse.

602
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:25,338
It was...

603
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,424
(sighs)

604
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:30,493
You incurred it
two weeks ago

605
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:32,178
near the corner
of 86th and Third.

606
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,963
The only thing there
is Carver Cemetery.

607
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:35,682
Obviously you were
visiting a grave.

608
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:37,100
Not a parent's grave,
of course,

609
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:38,685
Google indicates that
they're both alive and well.

610
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:40,269
Siblings? No.
Carver is a pauper's field.

611
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:42,838
The picture that you keep
on your phone of Mum and Dad

612
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,223
says that they're well-to-do.

613
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:46,893
No sibling of yours would be
interred in a place like that.

614
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:48,811
The place doesn't even have
a proper parking area,

615
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:50,463
hence the ticket.
So...

616
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:52,515
a surgeon who's
no longer a surgeon,

617
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:54,067
a parking violation incurred
outside poor man's cemetery,

618
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:56,285
and two parents who are as
moneyed as they are alive.

619
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:58,538
You add it all up.
What does it say?

620
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,908
You were visiting
the grave of the man

621
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,211
that you let die
on your operating table.

622
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:10,400
It's so incredible,

623
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:12,602
the way that you can...

624
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:15,772
solve people
just by looking at them.

625
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,659
I noticed you don't have
any mirrors around here.

626
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:21,527
And what's that
supposed to mean?

627
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,565
It means I think you know
a lost cause when you see one.

628
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:31,988
Tomorrow I'll arrange
for a new companion,

629
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,374
but tonight I've got plans.

630
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:52,775
Here you go.

631
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:54,043
Everything your
dead shrink

632
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:56,896
had on my dead friend.

633
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:59,399
You can thank me.

634
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,067
It's dusty.

635
00:28:01,069 --> 00:28:03,319
The guy's been dead
almost two years.

636
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:05,772
His widow had all
his stuff in storage.

637
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:08,591
You're lucky she even
let me take a look.

638
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:10,343
According to this,
Saldua never told him

639
00:28:10,345 --> 00:28:12,261
about the attack on
Eileen Renfro.

640
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:14,213
Just that he had an obsession
with redhead women,

641
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:16,282
and a tendency
towards violence.

642
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:17,533
Want something?

643
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:20,253
"Mr. Saldua, now obsessed
with his own recovery,

644
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:22,305
"has taken to recording
our sessions with his phone,

645
00:28:22,307 --> 00:28:24,373
so he can listen
to them again and again."

646
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,394
Has the phone
turned up yet?

647
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,962
No.

648
00:28:29,964 --> 00:28:31,631
I'm starting to think
he lost it.

649
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:33,149
Listen, I got
to take a leak.

650
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:34,967
Keep an eye on
this coat, will ya?

651
00:28:40,524 --> 00:28:44,060
MAN (over TV): God, it feels
good! Whether it's me,

652
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:45,361
or both of us...

653
00:28:45,363 --> 00:28:47,713
your ass is mine!

654
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:51,717
You're both dead!

655
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:55,905
Rage.

656
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:58,174
He felt rage.

657
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:02,028
(singing opera)

658
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:12,939
(whispers):
Watson!

659
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:19,462
(whispers):
Watson!

660
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:27,737
Excuse me.
Oh, my foot!

661
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:29,305
Excuse me.

662
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,945
Peter Saldua felt rage

663
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:37,830
the night he killed
Amy Dampier.

664
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:39,115
Now he had some
measure of control...

665
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,716
You're not here right
now. I don't see you.

666
00:29:40,718 --> 00:29:42,151
I don't hear you...
Shall I speak up?!

667
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:47,106
He had some measure of control

668
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:48,808
with Eileen Renfro,
but not with her.

669
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,860
Why?

670
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:53,162
Tell me, what exactly,

671
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:55,198
does a Xanax tablet
look like?

672
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,233
Small, white, ovular-- why?

673
00:29:57,235 --> 00:30:00,336
(line ringing)

674
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:04,857
Detective Abreu, please.

675
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:05,825
Shh.

676
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:07,877
"Shh" yourself.

677
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:10,530
Not even on key.

678
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,048
(phone rings)

679
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,382
Abreu.

680
00:30:13,384 --> 00:30:14,583
It's Sherlock Holmes.

681
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:15,985
Make it quick, Prince Charles.

682
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:17,386
I was just on my way out.

683
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:19,288
The pile vial from Saldua's
desk, I know it was taken

684
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,107
into evidence.
I need you to find it for me.

685
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:24,527
Hold on.

686
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,897
Now what?

687
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,749
The pills inside should be
white and ovular,

688
00:30:29,751 --> 00:30:32,818
but they're not, are they?
They're round and pink.

689
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:35,738
How did you know?

690
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:38,591
(click, dial tone)

691
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:40,109
I need a ride, right now.

692
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:42,378
I'm in the middle
of something.

693
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:47,617
You were right
the other day.

694
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:49,285
About Eileen Renfro.

695
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:52,421
I had no idea she would respond
to you the way that she did.

696
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:55,057
I just told you I did
because I was embarrassed

697
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,859
I'd lost my temper.

698
00:30:58,078 --> 00:31:01,214
Would I have gotten
to the truth some other way?

699
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:02,648
Of course, but...

700
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,717
you got me there faster.

701
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:08,571
Now, please,

702
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:11,173
how fast can you get me
to Sanbridge Hospital?

703
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,631
(car alarm chirps)

704
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:27,540
You were Peter Saldua's

705
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,892
last therapist,
weren't you?

706
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:31,427
You started treating him, what,
18 months ago?

707
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:33,529
Probably just a few weeks
before you talked your wife

708
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:34,764
into all that plastic surgery.

709
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,032
Excuse me?

710
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:37,216
Saldua wanted to fix himself.

711
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:39,368
<i>Dr. Jessup</i>
<i>was his first attempt.</i>

712
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,553
You were his second.

713
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:42,805
It's quite a bit
of luck, that.

714
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:45,524
You, a man with a wife
he wanted dead,

715
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:47,326
stumbling across him,

716
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,894
a man with an obsessive
personality

717
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,513
and a history of violence.
Hmm.

718
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:52,131
Only problem was, of course,

719
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:54,784
Amy didn't fit his victim
profile, did she?

720
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:56,535
But you accounted for that
by pressuring her

721
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:59,138
<i>to alter her appearance</i>
<i>until she did.</i>

722
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,724
Mr. Holmes, right?
We met the other day?

723
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:02,892
Yeah. The pill vial

724
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:04,760
from Saldua's home
came from you.

725
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:06,562
Sample from the hospital,
no doubt.

726
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:09,065
Almost impossible
to trace.

727
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,017
He thought he was taking
tranquilizers, but he wasn't,

728
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,969
<i>was he?</i>
<i>He was taking a steroid.</i>

729
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:14,737
You were whipping him
into a killing frenzy.

730
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,822
A frenzy that only made him
more and more confused,

731
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:18,374
<i>more violent,</i>

732
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,626
more likely to give in
to his terrible compulsions.

733
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:23,980
I never even heard
the name Peter Saldua

734
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:26,332
until the police told me he was
the man who killed Amy.

735
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:27,400
Bollocks.

736
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:28,567
I imagine that you
took to

737
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:29,902
meeting at odd places
at odd times,

738
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,704
<i>so you'd never</i>
<i>be seen together,</i>

739
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:33,306
and then when the time
was right...

740
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:34,940
you took advantage of his job

741
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:37,376
as a delivery man
to place him in Amy's orbit.

742
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:39,261
<i>You arranged for flowers</i>
<i>to be sent to the house</i>

743
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:41,430
once a week, 'cause you
needed him to see her.

744
00:32:41,432 --> 00:32:43,749
You needed him to become
obsessed with her.

745
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,618
You loaded him
like a weapon.

746
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,554
Then you pointed him squarely

747
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:50,389
at your own wife.

748
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:53,192
You're insane.

749
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:55,678
No, he was insane, Doctor.

750
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,664
And you took advantage.

751
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,500
And then after you'd
murdered him,

752
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:04,136
<i>you made it</i>
<i>look like a suicide.</i>

753
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:05,254
You took his phone.

754
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:06,856
Why? Well, because

755
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:08,891
he'd taken to recording
your sessions, as well.

756
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,626
Problem? Of course not.

757
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:12,128
Killing him was always
part of the plan.

758
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,380
You'd just take the phone
after you'd done the deed.

759
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:18,551
Hypothetically, Mr. Holmes,

760
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:23,039
a man wants out of his marriage
to a very wealthy wife.

761
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,674
He knows that during the course
of their relationship, he signed

762
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:27,376
a prenuptial agreement
that gives him nothing

763
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:28,744
if he leaves her,

764
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:31,797
and a living trust that gives
him everything if she dies.

765
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,433
Hypothetically, wouldn't
that man be smarter

766
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:36,619
to look for a way to
trigger the clauses

767
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:39,055
in the second document
as opposed to the first?

768
00:33:48,165 --> 00:33:50,116
What did he say?

769
00:33:50,118 --> 00:33:51,934
He said that he did it.

770
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,269
Well, we have
to tell the police.

771
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,270
No point.

772
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:57,773
We don't have any proof.
He knows it.

773
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:00,709
Need your car keys.

774
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:02,461
What? Why?
Car keys!

775
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:04,663
What...?

776
00:34:11,755 --> 00:34:13,439
(engine starting,
engine revving)

777
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:16,659
(tires squealing)

778
00:34:16,661 --> 00:34:19,311
(engine revving)

779
00:34:19,313 --> 00:34:21,013
(thudding, car alarm chirps)

780
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:26,068
Yes. (sniffing)

781
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,804
Better.

782
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,176
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

783
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,273
(keys jangle,
footsteps approach, door closes)

784
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:52,870
I'm sorry.

785
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:55,039
Not just for your car,

786
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:58,109
but for the way
I spoke to you earlier.

787
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:00,111
I knew that

788
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:02,138
the death of your patient would
be a sore subject. I just...

789
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,506
Couldn't help
yourself.

790
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:04,981
Yeah, I'm starting to see

791
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:07,225
how that's kind of a thing
with you.

792
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,949
I assume you've told my father

793
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:14,002
about what
happened tonight.

794
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:18,991
I'm going to miss
that brownstone.

795
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,509
Actually, you're not.

796
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:23,578
I spoke with him, and since
what you did at the hospital

797
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,080
had nothing to do with drugs,

798
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,082
he's agreed
to give you another chance.

799
00:35:28,284 --> 00:35:30,819
You've decided to stay on
as my companion,

800
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:32,987
haven't you?

801
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:35,257
You never would have
agreed if you hadn't...

802
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:40,912
I'm very pleased... Watson.

803
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:43,415
Oh, for myself, of course,
but for you.

804
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,703
I happen to think there's some
hope for you as an investigator.

805
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:51,189
I want you to let me in
on the rest of the plan.

806
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:53,358
To get Mantlo.

807
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,110
I know you wouldn't have
wrecked my car

808
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:58,413
unless it was part
of some elaborate...

809
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:03,118
...temper tantrum. Correct.

810
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,071
In that case, I want you
to tell me about London.

811
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:08,040
Big place. Lots of rain.

812
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,825
I want you to tell me

813
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:11,827
about what happened
to you in London.

814
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,311
Why is it so important to you?

815
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:15,013
Because if I'm gonna stay
with you,

816
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:16,231
I need to know everything.

817
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,833
Actually, you don't need
to know anything

818
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:19,468
other than
that I'm a recovering addict.

819
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,586
You want to know about London
because you think

820
00:36:21,588 --> 00:36:23,522
it'll connect us
in a more meaningful way.

821
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:24,923
But in case you hadn't noticed,

822
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:26,775
I don't have meaningful
connections.

823
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:30,462
Why are you smiling?

824
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:33,098
Because now I know
it was a woman.

825
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,918
What makes you say that?

826
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,771
You're trying too hard.

827
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:42,958
Just like you were the other day
with that tattooed lady.

828
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,360
All that sexist repellent crap.

829
00:36:45,362 --> 00:36:49,531
You can connect
to people.

830
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:52,267
It just frightens you.

831
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,873
My bail hearing
is at 9:00 tomorrow.

832
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,058
I trust I'll see you there.

836

That barrister
was rubbish.

837
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,114
I need to show you something.

838

This is Peter Saldua's
medical file.

839

Look under the "known
allergies" heading.

840
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,876
This was taken
the morning his body was found.

841
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,213
Weird, right?

842
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:29,965
No, actually.

843
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:33,118
Not even a little.

844
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:35,987
GREGSON:
Dr. Mantlo?

845
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,706
(clears throat)
Oh.

846
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:38,773
Sorry for the wait.

847
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,259
I appreciate you giving me
an opportunity

848
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:44,312
to apologize face-to-face
for what happened last night.

849
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:46,414
I can't promise
it'll change my mind

850
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:47,916
about suing the department

851
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:50,852
over what your consultant did
to my car, but it's a start.

852
00:38:50,854 --> 00:38:54,089
There is, uh, just one thing
I wanted to ask you.

853
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:57,592
Did you ever treat Peter Saldua
as a patient?

854
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,796
You have a funny way
of saying you're sorry, Captain.

855
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,182
It's a simple question, Doctor.

856
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:06,902
No. I never treated
Peter Saldua.

857
00:39:06,904 --> 00:39:08,720
I never even met the man.

858
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,072
Now, if that's it,

859
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:13,658
I am late for an appointment
with my attorney.

860
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,911
Detective!

861
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,131
You know you're just
digging yourself deeper,

862
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:21,433
putting this man

863
00:39:21,435 --> 00:39:22,918
in the same room with me?

864
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,053
Dr. Mantlo,
this is a medical form

865
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:27,889
completed by Peter Saldua
for another of his doctors.

866
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:30,642
As I've told you before,
Mr. Holmes-- I was never...

867
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:32,794
My assistant, Miss Watson,
was perusing it last night

868
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:35,897
when she very astutely noticed
that Saldua had a rather strong

869
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,065
allergy to rice.

870
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,683
This is ridiculous.

871
00:39:38,685 --> 00:39:40,134
Hmm. As I was saying,

872
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:42,938
Miss Watson noticed
Saldua's allergy to rice,

873
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,189
so you can imagine
her confusion

874
00:39:44,191 --> 00:39:45,624
when she remembered seeing
a sack of the stuff

875
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:46,975
<i>sitting on one</i>
<i>of his shelves.</i>

876
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,476
We also found
a credit card receipt

877
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:49,911
that told us he had bought it

878
00:39:49,913 --> 00:39:52,264
exactly three days
before his death.

879
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,665
Odd that, right?

880
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:54,816
Him going to the store

881
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:56,701
and buying the one thing
he's allergic to.

882
00:39:56,703 --> 00:39:59,704
Odder still, it was the same day
he stopped using his cell phone.

883
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:01,339
First, I thought
that was by choice.

884
00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:04,743
Then I remembered
the overturned washing machine.

885
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:06,795
What does a bag of rice

886
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:08,713
and an overturned
washing machine

887
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,432
have to do with anything?

888
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:11,833
I was wrong the other day

889
00:40:11,835 --> 00:40:14,102
when I accused you of
taking Saldua's phone

890
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:15,453
after you murdered him.

891
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,555
You wanted to take it,
but you couldn't, could you?

892
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:19,975
'Cause you couldn't find it.

893
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:21,860
He laundered it, you see?

894
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:25,179
Left it in his pocket when
he put his trousers in the wash.

895
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:27,215
But the time he realized,
it was too late.

896
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,651
The phone that he'd turned
into a virtual library

897
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:32,854
of his therapy sessions
was no longer functional.

898
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:35,190
<i>Furious with himself</i>
<i>and suffering the effects</i>

899
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,725
<i>of what he couldn't possibly</i>
<i>have known</i>

900
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:40,712
<i>was steroid intoxication,</i>
<i>he destroyed the washer</i>

901
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:42,330
in a fit of rage.

902
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:44,616
And then he went
to the nearest grocer's

903
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:46,434
and purchased a bag of rice.

904
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:47,869
(scoffs)

905
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:51,856
Rice, as you're apparently not
aware, is a natural desiccant.

906
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:53,675
It can be used
to absorb moisture

907
00:40:53,677 --> 00:40:56,177
from electronic devices that
have been immersed in water.

908
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:59,814
We went to Saldua's home
this morning

909
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:02,934
<i>and examined... his bag</i>

910
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:04,886
of rice.

911
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:07,322
You'll never guess
what we found inside.

912
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:11,426
(beep)
SALDUA: Her name is Amy.

913
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:14,128
And, um, when I see her,

914
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,098
I get these feelings, and I...

915
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,068
Please, Dr. Mantlo,

916
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,970
you need to help me.

917
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:25,040
You need to tell me how
to stop myself from hurting her.

918
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,108
I don't want to hurt her.
Please!

919
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,444
MANTLO:
It's okay, Peter. It's...

920
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,379
It's okay. I'm here for you.

921
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:35,834
Let's try upping your meds,
see where that leads us.

922
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:40,989

(sighs)

931
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:54,969
Okay, don't look at me
like that. You said

932
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,705
you were gonna watch with me
to make up for last night.

933
00:41:56,707 --> 00:41:58,206
That's before I got hungry.

934
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,874
Yeah, well, just because
you don't understand something

935
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:01,159
doesn't mean
it isn't awesome, okay?

936
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:02,260
Actually, Miss Watson,

937
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:03,611
quite familiar
with the American pastime.

938
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,346
The other addicts at Hemdale
would often gather

939
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,649
in the common room to watch
the matches on the telly.

940
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:09,434
They're not "matches,"
they're "games."

941
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:10,935
Truth be told,

942
00:42:10,937 --> 00:42:13,104
I find the science of the
sport quite fascinating.

943
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:15,507
All of the statistical analysis,
all of the strategy.

944
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:18,493
So if you'll allow me
to save us both a little time...
