1
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:16,798
How do you
know this guy again?

2
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,683
First time we've met, actually.

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,668
Bit odd, I know.

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,386
Postmortem bruising experiments

5
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:24,388
are more of
third date activity.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,691
No, I meant
the attendant.

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,109
You said he's a friend of yours.

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,727
We frequent the same
beekeeping chat room.

9
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,612
He has an impressive collection
of Caucasians.

10
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:34,815
Species of bee.

11
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:37,485
Course it is.

12
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:40,037
This is
important work, Watson.

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,123
It's crucial to my work

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,125
as an investigator.

15
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,210
These nameless
individuals agree,

16
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,613
which is why they have donated
their bodies to science.

17
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,966
Now help me roll this one over,
so I can try a chokehold.

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,088
I did say you were free not to
join me for these experiments.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,673
I know.

20
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,508
It's hardly surprising
that being in a hospital

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,676
makes you uncomfortable,

22
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,344
you being
a disgraced surgeon and all.

23
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm fine, okay?
You've had your arms crossed

24
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:07,431
for 13 of the 15 minutes
that we've been here.

25
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,716
It's a classic
self-comforting posture,

26
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:10,151
an attempt to neutralize
the distress signals

27
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,485
being sent by
your limbic system.

28
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,354
Of course, it is possible
that your stress

29
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:15,139
is subconscious and you really
do believe that you're fine.

30
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,275
But given that your eyes
are doing that thing they do

31
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:19,777
when you lie, I sincerely
doubt that's the case.

32
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:20,945
- I'm not lying.
- Doing it again.

33
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,997
Okay, I go where you go,
remember?

34
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,498
My comfort doesn't
factor in here.

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,334
If it did, I would not
have bought tickets

36
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,586
to the Arms and Armor
exhibit at the Met today.

37
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,904
Yes, they're displaying
new examples of lorica squamata.

38
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,039
Should be quite fascinating.

39
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,741
Just keep an eye on the clock.

40
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,259
If we don't leave in 20,
we're gonna be late.

41
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,183
Thank you, Bruce.

42
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,052
Good luck with
the new hive.

43
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,975
This body--
when's it being autopsied?

44
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,060
Never. Funeral home's
picking him up soon.

45
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:54,278
Died about an hour ago.

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,946
From a heart attack.

47
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,615
Yeah. How'd you know that?

48
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,067
There's a tiny blue dot
on the patient's head,

49
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,619
just below the hairline.

50
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,487
That's a tattoo used to
target radiation treatment,

51
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:05,573
which means the patient
had brain cancer;

52
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,575
blood clots are
a common complication.

53
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,943
He threw a clot, which led
to a pulmonary embolism,

54
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:11,612
which led to a heart attack.

55
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,497
Huh. We're in agreement
on the heart attack.

56
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,583
As to how it happened,
you're completely off base.

57
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,585
What room was he
in when he died?

58
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:19,303
Um, 704.

59
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:22,556
Where are you going?

60
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:23,841
The heart attack was
intended to look natural,

61
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,975
but it was induced
with epinephrine.

62
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,761
You've got it backwards.

63
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:28,596
Epinephrine is adrenaline;
it's given in all cardiac codes.

64
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:29,647
That's why it's perfect.

65
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:32,516
Excuse me.
The man who died in this room--

66
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:34,301
was there anybody with him
when the code thingy went off?

67
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:35,503
No.

68
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:36,854
Sir, that room
is being...

69
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,138
Stop cleaning immediately.

70
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,573
Don't touch anything else.

71
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:42,810
Who are you?

72
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,080
You should
probably take care of that

73
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,581
before somebody
slips and falls.

74
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,417
What is wrong with you?

75
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:53,087
How about you explain
what's going on

76
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,256
before he lets himself
back in?

77
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,992
Note the mark
on the dead man's finger.

78
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,494
Care to identify it?

79
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:01,595
It's ischemia.

80
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:02,830
Tissue death due to constriction

81
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,465
in the blood vessels
in the elbow.

82
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:06,751
Probably caused by the
epinephrine going into his arm.

83
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,136
And if he only received
the epinephrine during the code,

84
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,771
after his heart had stopped...

85
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,842
It wouldn't have had time
to cause the ischemia.

86
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:16,677
So, as far as
what's going on, Watson,

87
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,556
we're investigating a murder.

We can explain.
While we explain,

they will ruin

Lend me your former

96
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:54,660
The nurse said the victim
was alone when he coded,

97
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,212
but epinephrine
is fast-acting.

98
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:58,548
So, how did our killer
buy himself time to escape

99
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,601
before the onset of
the heart attack?

100
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:04,503
Well, if he injected
the epi into the I.V.

101
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,606
and then lowered the rate
on the infusion pump,

102
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,224
he would have at
least ten minutes

103
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:10,560
before the
patient coded.

104
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:13,813
It appears to be set
at 40cc's an hour.

105
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:15,965
That's just basic maintenance
fluid-- water, dextrose.

106
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:18,684
There's no reason it should be
slower than 100cc's.

107
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:20,203
Someone did turn the pump down.

108
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:21,971
Then we have
our method.

109
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:23,372
All right, we're coming in!

110
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:25,274
Sherlock, they're gonna
break down the door.

111
00:04:25,276 --> 00:04:28,294
Yeah, well, saves us the
bother of opening it.

112
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:29,796
I can live with missing
the squamata at the Met,

113
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:32,215
but I'd rather
not get arrested.

We're coming in!

115
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,757
Gentlemen, could one of you
point me in the direction

116
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,910
of the administrator's office?

117
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,063
This is ridiculous.

118
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:49,232
We're wasting
valuable time.

119
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:51,234
Just be glad the captain
got here when he did.

120
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:52,852
You could've ended up
in the psych ward.

121
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,153
Sure you'd have
been devastated.

122
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,989
Joanie?

123
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,407
Carrie, hi.

124
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:00,193
I didn't know you
were working here.

125
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:02,528
It's been, what,
about a year and a half?

126
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,896
Isn't this a small world?

127
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:06,299
Carrie, this is my
friend Sherlock Holmes.

128
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,783
Sherlock, this is
Dr. Carrie Dwyer.

129
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:09,702
- Hey.
- We used to work together.

130
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:11,737
Interesting that she didn't
refer to you as her friend.

131
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,606
Probably because of
your falling out.

132
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,208
You call her by
a familiar nickname and yet

133
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,876
you haven't spoken
in a year and a half.

134
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:19,045
What was it
that drove you two apart?

135
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,046
A man, job?

136
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:21,631
Failed sapphic dalliance?

137
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,082
Fingers crossed
for the last one.

138
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,684
He's got a form
of Tourette's.

139
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:28,421
Are you interviewing for
the spot in Cardiothoracic?

140
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:30,690
No, actually,
I'm done with medicine.

141
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:33,709
I thought your suspension
was only for a couple months?

142
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:34,727
It was.

143
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,563
I decided to move on.

144
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:38,597
Holmes.

145
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,866
It was good seeing you again.

146
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:42,068
Yeah, you, too.

147
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:46,956
Holmes, Ms. Watson,
this is Mr. Sanchez.

148

Administrator, correct?

149
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,193
Aka the guy who's still not
convinced he shouldn't

150
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:52,395
press charges against you for

151
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:53,996
barricading yourself
in one of our rooms.

152
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:55,915
And what's your role here?

153
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,284
Do you reach things
off high shelves for this one?

154
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:02,288
I'm Dr. Baldwin, I'm
the Head of Surgery.

155
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,724
And you were treating
the dead man?

156
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:06,175
No, but seeing as
he was pre-surgical,

157
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:07,944
it does fall under my
departmental purview.

158
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:10,162
All right, here's how things
are gonna shake out here.

159
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:12,398
Once you apologize
to Mr. Sanchez...

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,234
Apologize? I alerted him
to a murder at his hospital.

161
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:18,187
Once you've apologized
to Mr. Sanchez,

162
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,156
he'll release the
body to our M.E.

163
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:22,692
and allow CSU full
access to the room.

164
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:23,693
That's it?

165
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:24,810
You should
count yourself lucky

166
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,445
you're getting that much.

167
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:27,413
We need the dead man's name,

168
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,081
access to his medical records.

169
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,651
It would be a flagrant violation
of HIPAA guidelines.

170
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:33,452
Not to mention
the patient's privacy.

171
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,187
He's dead; do you think
he's worried about his privacy?

172
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:39,408
Holmes.

173
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,380
Can't believe I had to apologize
to that pencil-pusher.

174
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:46,332
Would you have preferred
he press charges?

175
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:47,850
Why are you in such a hurry?

176
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:49,685
We need to find
the woman.

177
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:52,004
The one who brought the victim
coffee before he was murdered.

178
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:53,689
There were two coffee
cups in his trash.

179
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,992
One of them had lipstick
on the lid.

180
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:59,695
Obviously a woman brought him
coffee shortly before he died.

181
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,680
- You think she killed him?
- It's possible.

182
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:04,033
At the very least, she might
be able to tell us his name!

183
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:05,851
But we don't know
anything about her.

184
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:07,536
No, but Dave might.

185
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:08,904
Who's Dave?

186
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,573
It's from a place
called Think Coffee.

187
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:12,191
The barista,
Dave, put his name

188
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:14,110
and number on the back.
Number's smudged,

189
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,578
so we can't call
him, unfortunately.

190
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,496
We'll just have to
find him at work.

191
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,749
Well, how do you know Dave was
a barista and not a customer?

192
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:22,418
Well, the receipt says she was
charged for two small coffees,

193
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,303
she received
two large.

194
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,922
Dave was flirting.

195
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:29,308
Tall half-skinny,
half-two-percent, extra hot,

196
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,595
split quad shot latte
with whip.

197
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:37,266
These coffee orders-- the Magna
Carta was less complicated.

198
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:40,853
Quite informative running into
your former friend, Carrie.

199
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:43,522
You'd allowed me to assume
you were no longer

200
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:44,940
permitted to practice medicine.

201
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,609
I'm not. I let my
license expire.

202
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,110
But that was your choice.

203
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:49,779
I hadn't realized

204
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:53,449
quite how traumatic it must
have been, losing your patient.

205
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,701
It's no small thing,
walking away from a career

206
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:57,370
requiring 12 years of training.

207
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:59,839
It's pretty hard to be a
surgeon when you freeze up

208
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,624
every time someone
hands you a scalpel.

209
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:04,243
I just didn't trust
myself anymore.

210
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,429
What can I do
for you folks?

211
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,764
Help us return this
to its rightful owner.

212
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,266
I give out my
number a lot.

213
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,351
Got to be in it to
win it, you know?

214
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,103
Speaking of which,
can I interest you

215
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,188
in a complimentary chai?
No, thanks.

216
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,523
The receipt indicates
she was here

217
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:20,559
at 8:35 a.m.,
wearing deep red lipstick.

218
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:23,029
Oh, yeah, the blonde.

219
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:25,081
Cleavage, tight
white skirt, heels.

220
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,732
And her perfume.

221
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,035
I mean, how often do
you meet a sexy doctor?

222
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,870
How do you know
she was a doctor?

223
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,389
She was wearing a white
lab coat under her jacket.

224
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:38,160
Ms. Cleavage is
not a doctor.

225
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:39,662
Of course she wasn't.

226
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,997
No doctor would wear her
lab coat out of the hospital.

227
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:45,000
Nor would she wear revealing
attire or heavy perfume,

228
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,785
which could trigger a
patient's asthma attack

229
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,387
or chemical sensitivity.

230
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:52,425
The lab coat is a bit
confounding, though.

231
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:55,561
Actually,
I don't think it is.

232
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:59,065
This chain only has
two stores in New York City,

233
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,216
so we have a 50/50 shot

234
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:03,986
of finding our
blonde here.

235
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,959
Try one in one.

236
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,410
I can't believe Trent's dead.

237
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:14,246
How exactly did
you know Mister...?

238
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,232
Kelty, Trent Kelty.
We were neighbors.

239
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:19,452
A few months ago, he told me
he was having trouble seeing.

240
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,253
He just thought
he needed new glasses.

241
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:22,521
Then they found the tumor.

242
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:24,790
After he lost his
eyesight completely,

243
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,492
I started visiting more.

244
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:28,611
I used to read him the
sports section from the Post.

245
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:30,212
You two were close.

246
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:31,363
Honestly,

247
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:32,664
I just felt bad for him.

248
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,983
Seemed like the right thing

249
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,518
to do, you know?

250
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,003
What time did you leave
the hospital this morning?

251
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:40,389
Oh, a little after 9:30. Why?

252
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,525
Because we have reason to
believe Mr. Kelty succumbed

253
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,443
to something other
than natural causes.

254
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:46,479
You think he was murdered?

255
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,347
Oh, quite certain,
I'm afraid.

256
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,232
Did anyone see you
leave the hospital?

257
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:51,784
Someone from
the nurses' station?

258
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:53,852
I don't know.

259
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,687
Um, I can give you
my Metro card.

260
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,623
That'll tell you
what time I caught my train

261
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,824
after I left.
Hmm.

262
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,077
I place Trent Kelty's
death around 10:30.

263
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,579
If she left at 9:30...

264
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,031
Too early for the epi
to have been administered.

265
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:07,716
She couldn't be the killer.

266
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:10,503
Thank you.

267
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,421
Can you think of
anyone who would've

268
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,056
wished to harm
Mr. Kelty?

269
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:16,592
Family member, romantic
partner, business partner.

270
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:18,210
One of the reasons
I made a point

271
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:19,845
to visit Trent
was he was so alone.

272
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:22,148
No family, hardly any friends.

273
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,985
The only other person he used
to talk to was this doctor

274
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,653
that used to
come by at night.

275
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:29,271
His doctor visited him at night?

276
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,306
Not his oncologist.

277
00:10:30,308 --> 00:10:33,442
Just a doctor
at the hospital.

278
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:36,612
They used to talk about his
cancer, how to manage the pain.

279
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,848
It seemed like he was
helping Trent cope

280
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,482
with what was coming.

281
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:41,867
His cancer was terminal?

282
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,953
He only had
a few months to live.

283
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,238
You didn't know?

284
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,456
You didn't happen to cut up

285
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,208
his food for him this morning,
did you?

286
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:51,744
Oh, the pancake?

287
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:53,912
No, it was like that
when I got there.

288
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:54,997
Why?

289
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:01,704
Whoever cut up
Trent Kelty's breakfast

290
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:03,739
came back after Jacqueline
left, killed him.

291
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:06,542
We may have a much bigger
problem on our hands

292
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,394
than this morning's homicide.

293
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:10,896
Because of
the pancakes?

294
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:12,931
You know I dislike
proposing a theory

295
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,451
in its formative stages
before I feel confident

296
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:16,919
of its conclusions.

297
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:19,771
Tell me.

298
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,091
We know that
Trent Kelty's killer

299
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,159
had some degree
of medical expertise.

300
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:26,445
We also know that
Trent was visited

301
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:29,715
almost exclusively by a man
claiming to be a doctor,

302
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:32,134
a man who I believe
cut an adult's food

303
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:34,053
into child-size bites.

304
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,555
Now, why would
a killer do that?

305
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,807
It reflects
a particular... mindset.

306
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,377
That of an individual
who tended to Trent's needs

307
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,630
not out of empathy but out
of a craving for his dependence.

308
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:46,565
And that mindset,
in turn, reflects

309
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,983
a particular kind of killer:

310
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,236
one who chooses victims
who are sick and weak,

311
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:52,488
one whose victims, he believes,
are doomed to die.

312
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,991
A man who would be drawn to
someone with a few months to live.

313
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:59,828
Someone whose preferred
hunting ground is a hospital. Why?

314
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,698
Because it provides
an endless supply of victims.

315
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,900
You're talking
about an Angel of Death.

316
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:08,287
If I'm right, Angels are
prolific, relentless.

317
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,839
Even if Trent Kelty
was our Angel's first kill,

318
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,458
it won't be his last.

319
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:25,182
Angel of Death here?
I don't know,

320
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:26,982
we've got some pretty
top-notch people on board.

321
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:28,667
I think they would
have sniffed it out.

322
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:29,906
It is just a theory,
for the moment,

323
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:32,041
but I've been right
about everything so far.

324
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,811
The autopsy showed that
Trent Kelty's epinephrine level

325
00:12:34,813 --> 00:12:37,713
was well in excess of what
he received during the code.

326
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,465
He was murdered.

327
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,951
I'm very sorry to hear that.

328
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,703
If I'm going
to prove

329
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:45,905
that someone is killing patients here,
I need information,

330
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:48,291
access to all medical records
of in-hospital deaths

331
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:49,826
and all logs relating
to the supply

332
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:50,893
and usage of epinephrine.

333
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,345
Why are you
talking to me?

334
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:54,497
Sanchez handles all the records.

335
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,666
I'm not talking to him, because
I know that he'll say no.

336
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,234
I came to see you,
because you smiled

337
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,186
when I made fun of his height
this morning.

338
00:13:00,188 --> 00:13:01,570
You don't like him.

339
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,539
I don't blame you.
You're also the head

340
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,792
of a very important department,
so your opinion carries

341
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:07,404
a lot of weight around here.

342
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,247
Okay,
I'll talk to him.

343
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,348
And by "talk,"
I mean I will threaten

344
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,051
to hold a press conference
to express my grave concerns

345
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,853
regarding this hospital's
apparent indifference

346
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:18,971
to the possibility
that a murderer

347
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,140
may be stalking
its halls.

348
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:24,227
You should have everything
you need in a couple of hours.

349
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,950
All this 'cause you made
a couple of short jokes.

350
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:32,368
Any luck?

351
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,020
Luck is an offensive,
abhorrent concept.

352
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,989
The idea that there is
a force in the universe

353
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,408
tilting events
in your favor

354
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,276
or against it is ridiculous.

355
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,911
Idiots rely on luck.

356
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:43,663
So that'd be a "no."

357
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:45,114
Fill me in.

358
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,499
Maybe I can help.

359
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,584
12 years of training,
remember?

360
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,837
We're in my wheelhouse.

361
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,339
Over the past two years
at Chandler Memorial,

362
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:57,810
73 seriously ill patients
have died of cardiac events.

363
00:13:57,812 --> 00:13:59,795
Well, chances are
some of those are natural.

364
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,348
I mean, sick people do
have heart attacks and die.

365
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,400
Which means that one,
none, or some of them

366
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:07,136
may have fallen victim to the
same person who killed Kelty.

367
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,472
But without the Angel's victims,
I can't see his pattern,

368
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,075
and without his pattern, I can't
develop a list of suspects.

369
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,443
Okay, so forget
potential victims.

370
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:14,827
Let's focus
on the murder weapon.

371
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,529
Epinephrine is hard
to get ahold of.

372
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,247
Even if our killer
had a prescription

373
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:19,832
because of an allergy,
he would have

374
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,334
a very limited amount.
It's more likely...

375
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:23,002
That he nicked it
from the hospital pharmacy.

376
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,653
I already checked the records.
The pharmacy reported

377
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,506
epinephrine missing
on only two occasions,

378
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:30,159
neither of which corresponds to
any of the 73 cardiac events.

379
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,095
Okay, then, the crash carts.

380
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,747
It's stocked with epi,
and they're usually unlocked.

381
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:35,998
I think the logs

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,084
are over here.

383
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,502
Okay, during 2011,

384
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,838
epi went missing from
various crash carts

385
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,923
on January 6...

386
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,007
March 19...

387
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,225
March 27...

388
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:48,511
June 20...
October 28.

389
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,396
That's a fair amount
of a drug to go missing

390
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,231
without anyone raising an alarm, no?
You know,

391
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,733
hospitals are more
worried about oxy

392
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,902
and other opiates being
sold on the street.

393
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:57,286
Epi doesn't qualify.

394
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,188
You ready for 2012?

395
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,323
'Kay, February 17...

396
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,440
April 4...

397
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,793
May 25...

398
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:05,328
September 19.

399
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,580
Each of the dates you mentioned

400
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:10,366
corresponds with one
of the 73 cardiac deaths.

401
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,603
If you're right, he's
killed nine people.

402
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:16,789
We have our pattern;
now we'll find our suspects.

403
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,293
23 suspects

404
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,044
is a lot--
how long do you think

405
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,147
it's gonna take you and
Detective Bell to interview them?

406
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,315
Far less time than it would
have taken to interview

407
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:29,485
the roughly 2,000 male doctors
and nurses I started with.

408
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:31,020
I cross-referenced
time cards to identify

409
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:33,406
men who were working on
the days of the murders,

410
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,608
then eliminated those who
did not have ready access

411
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,276
to floors where
the deaths occurred.

412
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,061
You said nurses--
Kelty told his neighbor

413
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,397
that the man who visited
him was a doctor.

414
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,199
Kelty was blind from
his tumor, remember?

415
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,868
For all he knew, his visitor
could've been a circus clown.

416
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,670
You go get started--
I'm gonna meet Carrie

417
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:49,338
for a coffee,
see if she can point us

418
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,023
in the direction
of any hospital oddballs.

419
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:06,589
About yesterday, I got
a bit carried away.

420
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,774
Apologies.

421
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,227
It's all right.

422
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,946
Shouldn't you be in
the conference room

423
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,282
starting your interrogations?

424
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,251
Well, I thought I'd start here.

425
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:37,086
With me? You serious?

426
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,038
I got you access to those files.

427
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,557
Calculated risk.
Perfect way to deflect suspicion

428
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,959
in the event
I eventually got access.

429
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,811
Okay.

430
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:48,297
If you say so.
By now,

431
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,349
I'm sure you've realized
three of the nine patients

432
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:53,069
I believe fell victim
to the Angel were yours.

433
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:54,437
Coincidence?

434
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,689
Uh, actually... no.

435
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:58,357
Not at all.

436
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,910
According to you, the Angel
kills severely ill patients.

437
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:03,179
I operate on
the sickest people we got.

438
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:06,082
Still, your practice shares
a certain casual attitude

439
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,833
towards life and death.

440
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:10,296
Your mortality rates
go up each year.

441
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,648
That's because I take on patients
that no one else will treat.

442
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:13,846
Last year the hospital

443
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,963
forced you to stop performing
an experimental procedure

444
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,182
when you racked up a 75%
failure rate.

445
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:20,388
There are risks
associated with innovation.

446
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,998
Lawsuits among them.

447
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,382
Among your failures

448
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,434
were two fatalities,
each of which

449
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:27,336
cost the hospital
several million dollars

450
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,621
when the families sued.

451
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:29,855
It's my understanding

452
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:31,390
you've been on
unofficial probation

453
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:32,975
since then--
one more mistake,

454
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:34,510
you're gone
from Chandler Memorial,

455
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,612
complete with a recommendation
to the State Board

456
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:37,813
to suspend your license.

457
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,315
Now, maybe you started
killing patients

458
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:41,200
to punish the hospital
for losing faith in you.

459
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,491
Or perhaps you just wanted
to feel like God again.

460
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:45,585
Okay, do you really want
to know why I'm not

461
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,956
the killer
that you're looking for?

462
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:49,959
This Angel, if he exists,

463
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,877
kills people who are pain.

464
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,829
It's a mission of mercy.

465
00:17:53,831 --> 00:17:55,414
Me, I'm a surgeon.

466
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,967
My favorite kind of patient
is unconscious on a table

467
00:17:57,969 --> 00:17:59,368
with a tube down his throat.

468
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,854
These people,
to be honest,

469
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:03,222
I'm not really interested

470
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,057
in whether they're
suffering or not.

471
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,709
It doesn't... really affect me,

472
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,428
and that's what makes me
exceptional at what I do.

473
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,046
So you're too indifferent
to your patients

474
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,682
to be the Angel of Death.

475
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,017
Novel alibi.

476
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:16,652
Well, there's
also the fact

477
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:19,722
that, uh, at the time
Mr. Kelty was killed...

478
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,157
yesterday...

479
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,093
I was on a train from
my home in White Plains.

480
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:27,480
But I got to get back
to work, and, uh...

481
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,032
it seems like you do, too.

482
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:34,170
Your friend who works
with the police,

483
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,671
he's sure there's
an Angel here?

484
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:37,590
Well, "sure" is a strong word,

485
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:40,459
but the pattern is
pretty hard to deny.

486
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,244
Oh, crap, I got to run.

487
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,613
- I have this pre-op consult.
- Okay.

488
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:46,132
You know, why don't
you come with me?

489
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,600
I'll keep trying to
think of weirdos.

490
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:48,968
- No, thanks, that's fine.
- Yeah, come on.

491
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,886
It'll only take
a few minutes.

492
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:55,891
Hi, Morgan.

493
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,777
This is my old friend,
Joan Watson.

494
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,378
Hi.
Hi.

495
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,530
Morgan's here 'cause
she tore her ACL.

496
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,098
Let me guess.

497
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,034
Soccer player,
right wing?

498
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,736
Center, actually.

499
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,604
Heart of the offense-- nice.

500
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:13,042
Okay, can you flex
your knee for me?

501
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:17,413
Are you a doctor, too?

502
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:19,865
No. Not anymore.

503
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,284
How come?

504
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,805
I'm just gonna take
a listen to your heart.

505
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:30,092
I'm afraid I'm
a little confused, Detective.

506
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:32,328
'Cause most of the people
you're asking me about

507
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,679
weren't even my patients.

508
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,948
Well, all nine of them
died of cardiac events

509
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,850
while you were on shift.
Oh, wow.

510
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:40,536
Nine sick people died in a hospital.
You assisted

511
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,421
in several of
their operations.

512
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:44,607
Yes, I'm a surgical resident--

513
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:47,176
I am involved
in lots of surgeries.

514
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:50,946
Look, I have been on call
for the last 29 hours,

515
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:52,832
haven't slept, barely eaten,

516
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:56,368
and still have an hour
drive home, so...

517
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,915
is there anything else
I can help you with?

518
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:00,336
Yeah, this guy here,
James Romano,

519
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:02,758
had pancreatic cancer.

520
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,810
One of the worst
forms there is.

521
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,545
I know, 'cause...

522
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:08,747
that's what killed
my grandmother.

523
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,718
Sometimes I wish...

524
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,887
I wish there
had been someone there

525
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:18,741
with the strength
to, uh... end

526
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:20,926
her pain.

527
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:25,147
You think someone
killed this man?

528
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:28,033
Th-The other patients, too?

529
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:31,070
He does. That's why he's trying
to gain your confidence,

530
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:32,872
suggest to you that
he's on your side,

531
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:35,524
that he actually empathizes
with someone

532
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,160
who would take a life
for the right reasons.

533
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:40,996
Only he's wasting his time;
you're free to go.

534
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,870
You want to tell me
why you did that?

535
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,588
Because it's highly unlikely
that he's our Angel.

536
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,925
That guy was so nervous, he was about
to come out of his skin.

537
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,260
You saw how
he was tapping

538
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:55,594
his keychain.
I also saw

539
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,096
how he stopped tapping
when he realized

540
00:20:57,098 --> 00:20:58,814
the only reason
he was called in here

541
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:00,266
was because
of the patient deaths.

542
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:02,384
Suddenly he relaxed
and the tapping stopped.

543
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,819
Which means...

544
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,821
even if he is a creep,

545
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:07,857
he's probably
not our killer.

546
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:10,025
And given the number of suspects
we have left to question...

547
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,994
I'll bring in the
next interview.

548
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:15,063
Thanks for your help in there.

549
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,565
She's been pretty scared.

550
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,450
Sure.

551
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:22,288
Hey, sorry if this is weird, but
I noticed something in there.

552
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,373
Splinter hemorrhage
under her toenail.

553
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,758
Yeah, she's a
soccer player.

554
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,343
She probably just
jammed her toe--

555
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:30,078
happens all the time.
Or it could be endocarditis.

556
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,764
Joanie, come on.

557
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:33,516
She's a healthy 12-year-old girl

558
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:36,084
with a bum knee,
not an I.V. drug user

559
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,722
or someone with
a congenital heart defect.

560
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,591
I just checked her heart.

561
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,843
I heard no murmur and no rub.

562
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,062
If she has endocarditis,

563
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:49,365
she could crash
during her surgery.

564
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,784
Please, just to be safe,
run an echocardiogram.

565
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:54,370
And she says
she's done with medicine.

566
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:56,906
Fine.

567
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:59,959
I'll order an echo,
just to be safe.

568
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:04,613
You and Bell really moved
through those interviews.

569
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,114
That's what happens

570
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,751
when you fail to turn
up a single solid lead.

571
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,252
No one jumped out at you?

572
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:11,720
Uh-uh. What about
your friend?

573
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:14,223
Any oddballs
come to mind?

574
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:16,926
I was right
earlier, wasn't I?

575
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:19,144
You two were close,
but not anymore.

576
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,431
After my patient died,

577
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,967
I lost touch with a lot
of my hospital friends.

578
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,435
Being around them
was difficult.

579
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:30,606
Carrie just didn't get it.
Speak of the devil.

580
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,274
Bad news?

581
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:33,809
Uh, good, actually.

582
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,611
I met one of Carrie's
patients today.

583
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,112
I thought she might
have endocarditis.

584
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,914
I asked her
to run a test.

585
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,366
Turns out I was wrong.

586
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:42,251
You're disappointed.
Of course I'm not.

587
00:22:42,253 --> 00:22:44,587
No, you didn't want
the patient to be sick,

588
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,121
but you wanted
to be right.

589
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:47,489
Are you sure
you weren't?

590
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,041
- Am I sure I wasn't what?
- Right.

591
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,426
This test she performed--

592
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:52,160
is it the gold standard
for endocarditis?

593
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,162
- Is it completely conclusive?
- No, but most cases...

594
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,664
Forget most cases.

595
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,633
What was your first instinct
when you saw the patient?

596
00:22:57,635 --> 00:23:00,486
That she had endocarditis.
Then hold the course.

597
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:01,937
Myriad studies have shown

598
00:23:01,939 --> 00:23:04,923
that first instincts
are typically the right ones.

599
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,593
What?

600
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,278
- What is it?
- That car.

601
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,531
I think it belongs to one
of my suspects, Dr. Cahill.

602
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,867
The bobcat sticker
on the bumper--

603
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,402
it matches
the one on his car key,

604
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:18,687
and his car key said
his car was a Nissan.

605
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,406
Okay, so that's his car.
What about it?

606
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:22,574
Well, Bell thought
that he was a solid suspect

607
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:23,876
for the Angel. I disagreed.

608
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:25,494
Thing is, as of
five hours ago,

609
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:26,912
Dr. Cahill wrapped up
a 30-hour shift.

610
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:28,831
Said he was going
to go home and sleep.

611
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,332
Legally, he's not allowed
to set foot

612
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:32,034
in the hospital
for another six hours.

613
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,552
When I got off call,

614
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:35,304
I couldn't get out
of the hospital fast enough.

615
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:37,873
So what's his car still
doing in the parking lot?

616
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,495
Dr. Cahill,
we meet again.

617
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:01,580
What-what the hell is this?

618
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:03,499
Hey, what-what do you think
you're doing?

619
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,584
Hey, get off of me!
I work here!

620
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:07,703
You're not gonna take
his word over mine.

621
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:11,090
Sherlock, I don't think
he's the Angel.

622
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,208
There's no epinephrine
in that syringe.

623
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,643
It's empty.

624
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:16,228
That's a PCA machine.

625
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,730
It dispenses morphine.

626
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,581
That's what
he was in here for.

627
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,917
He was trying to steal it.

628
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,103
So, we didn't
catch the Angel.

629
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:26,855
We caught an addict.

630
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,547
Stupid.

631
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,810
Registered his bloodshot eyes
and general twitchiness.

632
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,060
Chalked them up
to sleep deprivation.

633
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,179
I should probably have known
what he really was.

634
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,615
He was a doctor using
morphine on the job

635
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,066
and endangering
patients.

636
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,484
You caught him.
That's important.

637
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,286
W-Why are you taking
all those down?

638
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,821
'Cause they're
no longer suspects.

639
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,190
Your point regarding Dr. Cahill
would be quite heartening

640
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,826
if his drug habit
had anything to do

641
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,995
with the murderer currently
stalking the hospital.

642
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,463
A murderer who is most likely

643
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,298
targeting his next victim
as we speak.

644
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,699
A murderer I am no closer

645
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,384
to identifying
than I was this morning.

646
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:07,336
You met 23 people
in one day.

647
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,971
Maybe you missed
something.

648
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,924
I spent today soaking in
every word, every gesture,

649
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:15,928
every involuntary reaction
of these 23 former suspects.

650
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,398
Dr. Cahill was the only blip
on the radar.

651
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,051
Maybe not the
only blip.

652
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:25,988
All of the Angel's victims
were terminal...

653
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,824
except one-- her.

654
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:31,360
Samantha Cropsey. She was
the second to last victim.

655
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:34,664
She was quite sick, she'd been
in the ICU for two weeks.

656
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,616
Yes, but look here
in her chart: CABG.

657
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,869
That's Coronary Artery
Bypass Graft.

658
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,871
She'd had major surgery,
she was recovering slowly,

659
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,406
but she was recovering.
She wasn't going to die.

660
00:25:44,408 --> 00:25:47,076
So, why did the Angel
make an exception for her?

661
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:52,131
Captain?

662
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,934
That druggie doctor we scooped
up at the hospital tonight?

663
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:56,719
He's talking. A lot.

664
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,137
Turns out he might be able

665
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,339
to help us find the Angel
after all.

666
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:03,192
By the time I get out
of surgery, I'm wiped out

667
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,228
and keyed up,
all at the same time.

668
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,480
I can't sleep
without the morphine.

669
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,932
No, it's not like the patients
that you're stealing it from

670
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,767
need it to deal with
their excruciating pain.

671
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,936
I'm telling you this
because I want to help.

672
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:15,371
So help.

673
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,290
Tell him what you told me.

674
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:21,043
A couple months ago,
I snuck into a patient's room.

675
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,913
Older guy,
end stage liver cancer.

676
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,665
I knew he'd have morphine.

677
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,250
Raymond Sutter, Angel victim

678
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,385
number seven.
Once I got

679
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,053
the morphine out of the PCA,

680
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:33,673
I ducked into the bathroom to...

681
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,757
I believe the words
you're looking for

682
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,175
are "shoot" and "up."

683
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:39,512
And, uh, when I got myself
together to leave,

684
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,149
I realized someone was
coming into the room.

685
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:45,017
Did you see
his face?

686
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,936
I hid out in the bathroom
the whole time.

687
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,689
They talked
for, like, an hour.

688
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,807
Uh, I didn't recognize
the guy's voice,

689
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:55,394
but he was definitely a doctor,
talked a lot about medicine.

690
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:58,164
Were they discussing
Sutter's condition?

691
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,699
Yeah, yeah. The doctor explained

692
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,251
how the cancer
was shutting down his liver,

693
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,538
how the, uh... the toxins would
slowly build up in his body.

694
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,040
Really, you know,
laid it all out for the guy.

695
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:11,861
I could tell it wasn't
the first time talking about it.

696
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,013
The doctor knew that
the patient didn't have much

697
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:15,431
in the way of family.

698
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,018
And the next day...
died of a heart attack.

699
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,803
I didn't think
anything of it.

700
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,272
Except that you'd need to find
a new source for your morphine.

701
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:27,226
And when you and the detective
asked about an Angel of Death,

702
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,046
it got me wondering.

703
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,398
Didn't know how to tell you
what I'd heard

704
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,519
without explaining why I was
in that patient's bathroom.

705
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:40,189
Nothing like getting caught
to help one grow a conscience.

706
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,962
We're back on
track, Watson.

707
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:49,215
Dr. Cahill described a doctor
with an approach identical

708
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,966
to the one described
by the neighbor

709
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,701
who'd been visiting
Trent Kelty.

710
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:55,888
He talks to his victims, gets to
know them before he kills them.

711
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,556
Finally, our theoretical
Angel is proved real.

712
00:27:57,558 --> 00:27:59,041
Where are you going?

713
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:00,926
To take another look at
the hospital records.

714
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,312
Dr. Cahill's insights may
cast them in a new light.

715
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,814
You have copies
of the records at home.

716
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,265
I prefer to work
on the originals.

717
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,650
There's more detail,
more texture.

718
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,551
I was right about
the Angel, Watson.

719
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:10,820
As a wise man once said,

720
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,906
"First instinct,
usually the right one."

721
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,559
Joanie, hey.

722
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:20,329
I think you should run a T.E.E.
on Morgan before her surgery.

723
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,198
Her echo was clean,
as I expected.

724
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,783
She doesn't have
endocarditis.

725
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,235
25% of cases don't show up
on the standard echo.

726
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,254
In addition to her splinter
hemorrhage, she's pale.

727
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:29,872
I'm not subjecting
a 12-year-old

728
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,458
to a scary and invasive test
because you have a hunch.

729
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,410
- Okay, I know I'm overstepping...
- Yes, you are.

730
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,897
- Morgan is my patient, not yours.
- Okay, I understand.

731
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,515
I just... My gut is telling me

732
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,684
that if you operate
on her, she could die.

733
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,585
She'll be fine, Joan.

734
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:47,356
I'm operating
on her, not you.

735
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:56,031
Expected you an hour ago.

736
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:59,601
I went to the hospital to talk
to Carrie about her patient.

737
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:03,105
Victory?

738
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:05,891
I did what I could.

739
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,893
Well, on the bright side,

740
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:12,948
I've made a rather
important discovery.

741
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,950
Dariya Ruseckas' consent form.

742
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:19,054
- Uh, she's the fifth victim.
- Look closely.

743
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,622
It's a standard consent form
for an angiogram with contrast.

744
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:22,057
This is the
appropriate procedure.

745
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,426
Note the handwriting,

746
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,728
or rather, the handwritings.

747
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:29,565
Oh, they're two different kinds.

748
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,350
Dariya printed her name
and signed it,

749
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,398
but someone else filled out
the body of the form.

750
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,353
Exactly.

751
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,439
The nurse who initialed
the form here.

752
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,257
A.J. It stands
for Anichka Jones.

753
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,075
Jones, I'm assuming,
is a married name,

754
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:42,144
because "Anichka" is
as Ukrainian as it gets.

755
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:44,864
Explains why she filled out
the form for Ms. Ruseckas.

756
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,199
Because Miss Ruseckas,
born in Ukraine,

757
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:49,652
obviously did not speak enough
English to fill it out herself.

758
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,203
Okay.

759
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,339
The killer liked to converse
with his victims,

760
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:55,107
repeatedly and at great length.

761
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:57,593
Getting to know them was clearly
part of the process.

762
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,663
And he could have only gotten to
know her if he spoke Ukrainian.

763
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:03,299
We just need to check
the personnel records

764
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,767
for a doctor who knows it.

765
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,603
I already did.
There are none.

766
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,889
Then why are you so happy?

767
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,391
Because, Ms. Watson,
as you very well know,

768
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,110
not all doctors stay doctors.

769
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:18,847
Your lack of accent
is quite impressive, Mr. Gura.

770
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:20,316
Thank you.

771
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,668
I learned English as a boy.

772
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,453
Hmm. If I met you on the street,

773
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,622
I would never guess
you were a native Ukrainian.

774
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,408
But at work, well, the tools
of your trade gave you away.

775
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,378
Your janitor's cart--
you decorated the handle

776
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,497
with, uh, blue and yellow rags.

777
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,499
Since all of your cleaning rags
were white,

778
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,001
I knew that the fabric
was deliberately chosen,

779
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,536
and as I later realized,

780
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,955
representative of the colors
of the Ukrainian flag.

781
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:46,141
Then I pulled your personnel
file, and lo and behold,

782
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:48,761
under education,
you listed Olesky University.

783
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,647
Congratulations. Arguably,

784
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,632
best medical school
in all of Ukraine.

785
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:55,551
Not arguably.

786
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,036
Hmm.

787
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,488
Yes, I was a doctor in Ukraine.

788
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,890
Now I'm a janitor.

789
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:03,943
Is that why I'm here?

790
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,161
A problem
with how I clean the floors?

791
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:09,632
Actually, we thought
maybe you could help us.

792
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,184
Do you recognize any
of these people?

793
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:15,070
They were all patients
at the hospital.

794
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:17,289
"Were" being the operative word.

795
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,375
They're all dead now.

796
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:22,678
We believe they were all...

797
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,247
murdered.

798
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,302
Yes, I remember them.

799
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,821
Many of these patients
were very sick.

800
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:34,423
Even dying.

801
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,008
That makes it okay to kill them?

802
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,445
When a patient is in pain,
dying is not a tragedy.

803
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,063
It is a release.

804
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,549
You make it sound so noble.

805
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:48,270
The murder of defenseless,
sick people.

806
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,155
I'm sorry.
I still don't understand

807
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:52,041
why you want to speak with me.

808
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,792
We got a warrant, Mr. Gura.

809
00:31:53,794 --> 00:31:55,377
We searched your
apartment this morning

810
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,446
while you were
at the hospital,

811
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,965
and we found... this.

812
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,884
It's a log

813
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,953
filled with medical notes,
written by you.

814
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:07,973
Exclusively
about these nine patients.

815
00:32:07,975 --> 00:32:12,411
And we know that you're the man
who killed them.

816
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:20,653
I freed them.

817
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:23,572
I freed them
from the pain-wracked prison

818
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,441
their bodies had become.

819
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,627
I saw them,

820
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:31,580
I studied them.

821
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:35,984
Confirmed for myself there was
no chance at recovering,

822
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:38,654
that all they had to live for

823
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,839
was the horror of dying.

824
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:44,076
And I did what
needed to be done.

825
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:47,129
I showed them mercy.

826
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,332
What about Samantha Cropsey?

827
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,885
- What about her?
- She was getting better.

828
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,188
How can you call
what you did to her mercy?

829
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,257
Better?

830
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:02,511
People do not get better from
metastasized cardiac cancer.

831
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,779
She didn't have cancer.

832
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,180
She was recovering
from bypass surgery.

833
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:06,849
Her-her blood pressure
was improving,

834
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,283
her oxygen saturation...

835
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:09,952
No. You're wrong.

836
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,237
- They'd found a mass in her heart.
- What happened?

837
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,373
Did you get bored of waiting
for somebody sick enough?

838
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,042
The pain was so bad,
she could hardly form sentences.

839
00:33:17,044 --> 00:33:19,128
She was begging me to make it stop.
She had her entire life

840
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,945
ahead of her!
No!

841
00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:22,197
She was dying.

842
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,000
You're no better
than the police

843
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:27,536
in Soviet Ukraine,

844
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:31,173
making up
lies to suit your truths.

845
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,260
I am done talking.

846
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:37,730
You've said
quite enough.

847
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:45,053
Holmes.

848
00:33:49,743 --> 00:33:51,744
Great work.

849
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:53,662
We'll take it
from here.

850
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,364
What, what is it?

851
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,417
He's telling the truth o-or
at least he thinks he is.

852
00:33:58,419 --> 00:33:59,702
About being the Angel?

853
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,537
About Samantha
Cropsey's condition.

854
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,738
He's convinced
she was suffering

855
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,590
from terminal
cardiac cancer.

856
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:05,874
Well, he's also convinced

857
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,926
that he helped those people
that he killed.

858
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:09,128
He's a lunatic.

859
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,797
What'd you expect?

860
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,017
I don't know,
just not this.

861
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,354
I was thinking
sushi tonight.

862
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,773
Salmonella,
Vibrio parahaemolyticus,

863
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,441
mercury poisoning,
Anisakis simplex:

864
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:38,527
all illnesses contractible
from eating raw fish.

865
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:40,279
Anisakis, of particular note,

866
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:42,147
is a worm that can burrow
into the wall of the intestine,

867
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,498
often requiring
surgery

868
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,584
to remove it,
but, yeah, sushi's good.

869
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:47,152
Why are you still

870
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,004
looking through those files?
You caught the Angel.

871
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,172
I caught someone
who is

872
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:51,923
smart, medically knowledgeable,

873
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,543
and fiercely attentive
to detail.

874
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:55,927
His notes
on Samantha Cropsey's condition

875
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,162
say that cardiac cancer

876
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:59,831
was discovered
during her bypass surgery.

877
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,466
Why did he get it so wrong,

878
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:05,220
and why is he so convinced
he was right?

879
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,473
You expecting
someone?

880
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,892
Am I ever?

881
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,898
Mr. Holmes, right?

882
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,583
We met the other day.

883
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:20,685
Joanie's friend.

884
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,491
I got your information
from Bruce in the morgue.

885
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:29,444
He seemed to think I might
be able to find her here.

886
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:31,863
Watson, it's for you!

887
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,368
Carrie.

888
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,558
I wanted you to know
you were right.

889
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,093
Morgan had
endocarditis.

890
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:47,396
The lab found it
when they ran a T.E.E.,

891
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:48,730
which, coincidentally,
is the test

892
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,816
you wanted me
to run on her.

893
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,768
The funny thing is,
I didn't order it.

894
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,053
Some anonymous person

895
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:58,423
put the request in her chart
and the lab followed through.

896
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,110
Remember, on our
vascular rotation,

897
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:04,729
how the chief resident
always used to say,

898
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:07,232
"Better lucky
than good"?

899
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,434
Sounds to me like
you were lucky.

900
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:13,288
Yeah, I guess I was.

901
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:17,175
I know what it's like
not to be lucky.

902
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:21,630
It turned my life
upside-down.

903
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,050
You were always
a good friend, Joanie,

904
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:27,436
but you were
a better doctor.

905
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,282
Aren't you full
of surprises?

906
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:42,200
Of course you were listening.

907
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,820
Altering the girl's
chart, saving her life.

908
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:47,622
Apparently your instincts
were spot on.

909
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:48,657
Well done.

910
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:50,792
Thank you.

911
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,295
Actually it's me who
should be thanking you.

912
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,263
You've given me an idea
as to why Danilo Gura

913
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:56,915
would have killed
Samantha Cropsey.

914
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:58,250
Get your coat.

915
00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:00,285
I need to speak
with Danilo right away.

916
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:03,288
I think he may have been
holding out on us.

917
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:08,293
Dr. Baldwin,

918
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:12,230
you are a brilliant man,
are you not?

919
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,232
You didn't tell me
he was going to be here.

920
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:16,318
I asked you
a question.

921
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,487
Are you a, a
brilliant man?

922
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,973
You're a step ahead of everybody
for long enough,

923
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:23,608
people start calling you
brilliant.

924
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,977
I get a feeling that you know
something about that.

925
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:27,913
Ah, indeed I do.

926
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,698
One of the dangers of
brilliance, however,

927
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,483
is that you sometimes
fail to recognize

928
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:32,984
the possibility
that others are--

929
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:37,489
at least in some respect--
just as brilliant.

930
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:40,342
Last night, for example,
it occurred to me,

931
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,010
I may not have been
the first person

932
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,546
to discover the Angel of
Death at Chandler Memorial.

933
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:47,599
I'm sorry, you're saying
that someone else knew

934
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,185
that he was there
but kept it to themself?

935
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,137
A brilliant someone,

936
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:55,840
in this case a brilliant someone
with extensive medical knowledge

937
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,842
and real reason
to pay close attention

938
00:37:57,844 --> 00:38:00,595
to the sudden death
of two of his surgical patients.

939
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:02,230
Okay, if you're referring to me,

940
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:05,984
I can assure you I had no idea
what Danilo Gura was up to.

941
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:07,986
We checked the
morgue security logs.

942
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:10,522
Apparently you went there
to examine the two bodies

943
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:12,207
of the first two
patients you lost

944
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,208
to the Angel.

945
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,577
They were my patients.

946
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:17,829
I wanted to know what happened.

947
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:19,531
I didn't find out
anything unusual.

948
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,700
I believe that you did realize
they had been murdered.

949
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:24,702
Perhaps you noticed
a bit of ischemia,

950
00:38:24,704 --> 00:38:27,923
as brilliant men
are wont to do,

951
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,307
but around the same time

952
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:32,377
you committed
yet another surgical error.

953
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:34,646
You left a clamp
in Samantha Cropsey's chest

954
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:37,015
during a routine bypass surgery.

955
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:38,984
Okay, I've had
just about enough of this.

956
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,318
Whoa.
It was inevitable

957
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Samantha would develop
complications.

958
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,773
The mistake could have been
easily rectified,

959
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:47,158
the clamp removed,
but not without earning you

960
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,530
your third strike and ending
your formerly great career...

961
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:54,082
unless the Angel
could make it all go away.

962
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:57,035
You realized that
he targeted patients

963
00:38:57,037 --> 00:39:01,239
who were not only terminal
but also in tremendous pain,

964
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:04,376
so you set about making Samantha
an attractive target.

965
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:07,045
First you found
the biopsy of a patient

966
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:08,663
dying of cardiac cancer.

967
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:11,099
You put Samantha's name
on the biopsy results,

968
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,368
you noted that the tumor
was found during her surgery,

969
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,203
and then you placed them
into her chart.

970
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:17,606
Secondly you made sure
that she was in pain

971
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,225
so the Angel would feel
compelled to end her suffering.

972
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:21,759
That was
simple enough.

973
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:24,112
Just reduce
her pain meds.

974
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,815
Now, this had the added benefit
of making her too delirious

975
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:28,950
to effectively communicate
with a killer who liked

976
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,535
to chat up his victims.

977
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,737
The Angel took the bait.

978
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:35,123
Samantha succumbed
to a cardiac event.

979
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,774
Now, all you had
to do was remove

980
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:38,743
those cancer results
from her chart

981
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:42,447
and your mistake was erased
until today.

982
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,316
We received
permission to exhume

983
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:46,718
Ms. Cropsey's body.

984
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,756
The M.E. found this lodged
in her ribcage.

985
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,508
It's a surgical clamp.

986
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,393
Look familiar?

987
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,813
Let's say that I believe you.

988
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:02,684
Let's say
that you actually found that

989
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:04,486
in Samantha's remains.

990
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,821
All you've proven is
that I made a mistake--

991
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,240
a mistake that'll probably end
my career

992
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,942
and keep me from helping
thousands of people--

993
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:14,446
but I see no evidence at all
that I faked records

994
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:15,830
or that I killed
people.

995
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,582
Excellent points,

996
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:21,419
which is why I visited
Danilo Gura late last night.

997
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:25,457
His patient logs were
so detailed, so comprehensive,

998
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,459
first I suspected
he must have copied the data

999
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,177
directly from the charts.

1000
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,213
But why would he risk doing that
in a hospital

1001
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:34,349
where someone could walk in
at any moment?

1002
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,718
Then it hit me:

1003
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,054
he'd taken pictures.

1004
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,108
Like this one for example.

1005
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,844
At first

1006
00:40:46,846 --> 00:40:50,315
he refused to acknowledge
the photos' existence,

1007
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:52,183
but after I explained how
you had manipulated him

1008
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:54,486
into violating
his code,

1009
00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:56,187
he told us we could find them
on a flash drive

1010
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:58,690
he had hidden
in a vent near his apartment.

1011
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:00,575
God forbid either of you
should ever need surgery

1012
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:02,243
to save your life.

1013
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:05,296
I am the guy you want
standing over you in the O.R.

1014
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:06,881
I imagine it was
that kind of thinking

1015
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:09,084
that helped you justify
Samantha's murder.

1016
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:12,837
Her life versus the thousands
you believed you'd save.

1017
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,389
I was talking to the D.A.

1018
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:15,423
this morning.

1019
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:17,726
He figures
murder two is a lock.

1020
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,728
You're looking
at 20 to life.

1021
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,714
Chandler Memorial Hospital

1022
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:25,834
was rocked by scandal
for the second time in two days

1023
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:28,670
when Dr. Mason Baldwin was
arrested for his role

1024
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:30,388
in the death of one

1025
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,941
of confessed Angel of Death
Danilo Gura's victims.

1026
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:33,942
Recent...

1027
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:39,564
My favorite bit--
this moment.

1028
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:44,119
The slumped shoulders,
the pallor,

1029
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:47,322
like a turtle trying to
retreat back into its shell.

1030
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,575
I'm happy for you.

1031
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:55,213
I'm also exhausted,
I'm turning in.

1032
00:41:55,215 --> 00:41:57,182
I must say, Watson,

1033
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,185
I enjoyed catching a glimpse
of you in your former element.

1034
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:03,271
Seems to me
your friend was right.

1035
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,256
You were quite a doctor.

1036
00:42:05,258 --> 00:42:07,358
I had my moments.
