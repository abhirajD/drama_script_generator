1
00:00:00,092 --> 00:00:02,927
Previously on Elementary...
Irene Adler.

2
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:04,477
Got killed
in her flat.

3
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:05,478
Year and a half ago.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,180
That was Moriarty.

5
00:00:07,182 --> 00:00:08,798
And whom do I have the pleasure
of speaking to?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,299
My name is Moriarty.

7
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,352
Irene Adler--
did you have her killed?

8
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:14,688
That is the question, is it not?

9
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,905
What was she like?

10
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:18,324
To me... the woman.

11
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:20,243
To me, she eclipsed
and predominated

12
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:21,528
the whole of her gender.

13
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,079
What do you think's
inside?

14
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:25,699
The reasons I'm here
are personal.

15
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,650
Irene?

16
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,986
Irene.

17
00:00:31,922 --> 00:00:35,175
Irene. Oh, Irene. Irene.

18
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,378
Irene!

19
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:01,234
Door's open.

20
00:01:06,407 --> 00:01:08,908
Hi. You must
be the P.I.

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,461
Consulting detective, yes.

22
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,630
Sherlock Holmes.

23
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:16,049
Consulting detective?

24
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,968
Is that different
from a P.I.?

25
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,255
There's considerably less
clandestine photography

26
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,591
of cheating spouses, yeah.

27
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:26,760
Uh, as I mentioned
in my e-mail,

28
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:29,145
I'm looking into a matter
for a friend of mine

29
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:31,514
who procures items for
auction at Christie's.

30
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:33,549
Now, Mr. Kirby of
the British Museum

31
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,418
said that as
his top restorer,

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,487
you were the
person to see.

33
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:41,390
Nice of Mr. Kirby.

34
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:45,829
Irene Adler. Nice to meet...

35
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,563
Oh.

36
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,415
You're beautiful.

37
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:51,901
Symmetry-- I'm...

38
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,570
trained to be
on the lookout for it.

39
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,072
Hmm.

40
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,174
Anyway, I looked
at those pictures you e-mailed.

41
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,794
Tell your friend at
Christie's that, I'm sorry,

42
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:04,047
but those canvasses
aren't original Turners.

43
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,298
You're certain?

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,350
The provenance
is quite convincing.

45
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:10,854
Yeah. They're good forgeries
but, you know,

46
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:13,223
they're forgeries.
They're supposed to be

47
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:15,024
the studies
for The Fighting Temeraire,

48
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:18,611
but they have a... a medium
orange and ochre in them.

49
00:02:18,613 --> 00:02:21,564
In 1839, you needed
turmeric to make

50
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:22,899
ochre paint.

51
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:25,702
But 1839 was also
the beginning of your

52
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,603
Afghan war; the army

53
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:31,074
commandeered turmeric for
a preservative in rations.

54
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:35,078
That's why you don't see ochre
in The Fighting Temeraire.

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,463
Or any painting
from back then.

56
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:39,082
Hmm.

57
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:42,785
I'm surprised
I hadn't realized that. Yet.

58
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,787
Shame, really.

59
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,173
The world would be
a more interesting place

60
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:50,143
with a few new
Turners in it.

61
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:55,315
So these are all your...
work, are they?

62
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:58,151
Mm-hmm.

63
00:02:58,153 --> 00:02:59,819
Hmm.

64
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:02,488
You're very gifted.

65
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,024
Do you do original work?

66
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:09,879
What could I add to all this?
What could anyone?

67
00:03:23,544 --> 00:03:26,429
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to linger, I just...

68
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,551
It's just... if these were all
supposed to be reproductions,

69
00:03:31,553 --> 00:03:34,220
what is the original
of Brueghel's The Blind

70
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:35,722
Leading the Blind
doing on your wall?

71
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:37,140
I wonder what

72
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,725
the director of the
Belgian National Museum

73
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:41,010
would have to say if he knew
that you had returned

74
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,398
your work to him and passed
it off as the real thing.

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,183
How could you possibly
know that?

76
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,236
The original was damaged
by shelling

77
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,038
during the Great War.

78
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,325
Hard to see why you,
a restorer by trade,

79
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,694
would recreate the gouges
in the canvas.

80
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,714
I'm curious-- you don't
intend to sell it,

81
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,367
so why take the risk?

82
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:11,507
The museum director wanted
to file down the paint

83
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:13,676
where the gouges were.

84
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,895
I told him
that that would compromise

85
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,881
what the artist intended,
but he didn't see it my way,

86
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,516
so I...

87
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,718
preserved it.

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,687
I see.

89
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,723
And some of these
other paintings are...

90
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,158
preserved as well,

91
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,910
are they?

92
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:32,946
Hmm.

93
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:35,698
A bargain then.

94
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,835
I'll tell you which of the
paintings are reproductions

95
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:43,256
and which of them are counts
of felonious theft.

96
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,876
And if I deduce correctly,

97
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:50,763
you'll spend an evening
in this great city with me.

98
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:52,915
You're not going to turn me in?

99
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,968
I appreciate your efforts
to keep the vulgarities

100
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,552
of the modern
era at bay.

101
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,688
Whether you agree
to my game or not,

102
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,474
I'll leave you to your work.

103
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:05,594
I assure you, we would enjoy
each other's company.

104
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,565
I have no wish
to coerce your attentions.

105
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,150
You're not boring at all,
are you?

106
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:13,953
I make every effort not to be.

107
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:19,442
I accept, but I do
have one question.

108
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,462
I've already told you
that you're beautiful,

109
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:25,465
and I can see the way
you're looking at me.

110
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,800
Why would we need
to leave this apartment

111
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,802
to enjoy each other's company?

112
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,343
A game with proper stakes then.

113
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:40,629
Shall we?

114
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,356
Hmm.

115
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:53,976
Ms. Adler, I understand
you're disoriented,

116
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,396
but it really is 2013.

117
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,315
No. Mr. Stapleton told me

118
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,451
it was my birthday
seven different times.

119
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,369
He was lying.

120
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:08,424
Dr. Stone, 2945.

121
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:13,046
Dr. Stone, 2945.

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,688
I'm here, if you want to talk.

123
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:29,162
I can't even imagine what you
must be thinking right now.

124
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:34,350
Hey.

125
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,818
Hey.

126
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,370
What did you find
at the house?

127
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:41,074
Not much of anything yet.
CSU's there with Bell.

128
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,544
Is that her?
That's Irene?

129
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,550
I, uh...

130
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:55,704
Your friend is fine.
Physically.

131
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,590
But if I had to put
a name on it, I would say

132
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:00,593
that she's suffering from
severe post-traumatic stress.

133
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:02,011
What happened to her?

134
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:03,712
She doesn't remember
everything clearly,

135
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,550
but she was abducted,
moved from place to place.

136
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,886
There were five
that she told me about.

137
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,333
And then she was subjected

138
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:13,503
to advanced psychological
pressure tactics.

139
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,243
Seems that somebody had set out
to systematically destroy

140
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:18,828
this young woman's personality,

141
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,166
and, for the life of me,
I cannot give you a reason why.

142
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:25,618
Did she talk about the people
who took her?

143
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,121
She dealt
with only one person.

144
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,940
He named himself
Mr. Stapleton.

145
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:34,110
By day, he tinkered
with her mind,

146
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:37,647
left white peonies
by her bed at night.

147
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,850
Punishment, reward--
all designed

148
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:43,252
to make Ms. Adler
psychologically dependent

149
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,054
on her captor.

150
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,440
Did you get a description
of Mr. Stapleton?

151
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:49,559
She said he was white,
about five-ten,

152
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:51,144
but as far as what
he looked like,

153
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:54,447
she drew this.

154
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,932
He was wearing it every time
she spoke to him.

155
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,768
I've given her a sedative,

156
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,771
and we're gonna keep her
on a psych hold for a few days.

157
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,956
Thank you, Doctor.

158
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,833
It's odd to hear that man wonder
why this happened to Irene.

159
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:19,472
It was because of me.

160
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,626
Moriarty...

161
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,846
wanted me to believe
that she was dead,

162
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,482
let me mourn her,

163
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:32,435
get addicted to heroin.

164
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,820
And then when I made steps
towards recovery,

165
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:38,191
he sends her back to me.

166
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:41,577
Well... part of her.

167
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,165
Yeah, where'd
all her blood come from?

168
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:53,689
How did I not know
that she was alive?

169
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,326
What-what did I miss?

170
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:01,380
Can you give us
a minute?

171
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:04,383
Oh, yeah. Sure.

172
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:18,614
Irene has been
hurt badly,

173
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:22,652
but she's alive and
she can get better.

174
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,871
You can help her.
Yes, of course.

175
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:28,291
Whatever she needs.

176
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:30,693
We've got clues.

177
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,696
We can go and find that man.
We can go back to the house...

178
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,882
No, uh, I shan't be
consulting on Irene's case.

179
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,904
Do you really want
to sit this one out?

180
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:44,473
I need to look after her.

181
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,477
Besides, I don't think
I'd be much use.

Moriarty is quite clearly
smarter than I am.

I do know that
I want you to work.

We've been in the hospital

And if you're going to help
find the people who took Irene,

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,554
you need to get cracking.

214
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:09,222
Well, I've never
consulted without you before.

215
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:10,974
Well, I am confident
that Captain Gregson

216
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,426
and Detective Bell can
handle the transition neatly.

217

Excuse me.

218
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,771
You lurk.

I do.

I'm not your sober
companion anymore.

But I know a relapse trigger

Now go.

My water turns hot,

Holmes really
isn't coming, huh?

227
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,435
No. He wants
to take care of Irene.

228
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:58,254
I mean, if things were normal,
I'd say, there's no way

229
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:00,590
he sits out
an entire investigation,

230
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,525
but right now, who knows?

231
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,944
He's really thrown by all this.

232
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:07,147
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

233
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,432
Let me ask
you something.

234
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,601
You believe this
guy is real?

235
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:13,436
Moriarty?

236
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:15,104
I do.

237
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,739
No Holmes?

238
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:19,075
Well, finally
tracked down the owner.

239
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:21,611
I don't think we're gonna
learn too much from him.

240
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:23,496
He's nine,
and he lives in Austria.

241
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,165
Kid's never even seen the place.

242
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:28,284
He inherited it from his uncle
when he was three years old.

243
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:29,636
Trust paid for a caretaker

244
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:31,588
to come out
a couple times a year.

245
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,122
The caretaker didn't
see anything, either.

246
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,225
They must not have held
her here that long.

247
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:37,977
Did you find anything
when you looked around?

248
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,646
Well, nothing much.
That Stapleton guy

249
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,564
had to know
you were coming.

250
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,233
He cleaned
the place out.

251
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:45,652
No one who lives in the area
saw anyone coming or going.

252
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:47,070
Oh.

253
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:48,471
Hmm? You got
something?

254
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:49,822
Maybe nothing.

255
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:52,492
Um... I have
these reading assignments.

256
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:54,611
It's part of my training
with Sherlock.

257
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:58,031
Lately, it's been about art--
how it's forged, stolen,

258
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,449
sold on the black market.

259
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,618
I just read
about this color-- gamboge.

260
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,369
See, I usually
just go with yellow.

261
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:04,987
Well, it's the kind
of yellow.

262
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:06,539
See how bright
the pigment is?

263
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,990
Gamboge comes from a resin.

264
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:10,159
It's harvested in these trees.

265
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:13,179
It's found in Southern Vietnam,
Cambodia, Thailand.

266
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:14,681
It takes a long time
to harvest,

267
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:16,349
so it's rare,
and so is this brand.

268
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:18,101
I'm guessing there's only
a handful of places

269
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:19,502
in New York that carry it.

270
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:22,338
Somebody had to buy this
for Irene, right?

271
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,607
If we figure out
where it came from,

272
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:27,193
maybe we can find out
who was watching her.

273
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,180
Feels just like having
Holmes here, doesn't it?

274
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,949
Hmm.

275
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,692
Miss Adler.

276
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,694
Sherlock Holmes, P.I. Hi.

277
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:46,329
Uh, apologies
for the ambush.

278
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:48,665
I was just... I arrived
just as you were leaving.

279
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,033
No problem. What's up?

280
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:53,636
Yes, well, it's been
several weeks

281
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,922
since our
meeting-turned-interrogation

282
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:58,258
turned... sexual marathon.

283
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,893
A memorable afternoon
and evening.

284
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:03,179
I'm sure you'd agree.

285
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:05,815
Yet, each time I've tried
to arrange for an encore,

286
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:09,986
I've been politely,
but unmistakably rebuffed,

287
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:12,655
as if your right,
of course.

288
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:15,391
Although, I admit, I'm not
accustomed to rebuffings.

289
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:16,659
You're not accustomed to being

290
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:18,494
on the receiving
end of rebuffings.

291
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:21,781
Quite so. It seems to me,

292
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:23,950
we had an experience
worth repeating.

293
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:26,402
Just... I'm curious
as to why you differ.

294
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:27,870
I don't differ.

295
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:30,206
I reject your whole premise.

296
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,875
Our afternoon was one
of the most unique

297
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:34,377
and memorable of my life.

298
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,296
It can't be repeated.

299
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:38,414
We could try,
but that's just a game

300
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,516
of diminishing returns,
isn't it?

301
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,436
I'd rather just remember it
the way it was.

302
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:46,272
You preserve the integrity
of the initial encounter

303
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,474
by denying yourself
further ones.

304
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:50,193
Interesting.

305
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:52,278
People don't treasure
things anymore.

306
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,864
You should try it.

307
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,203
You're not boring
at all, are you?

308
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,104
I try not to be.

309
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:04,040
What if I could offer you

310
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,292
another entirely
unique experience?

311
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:07,910
Surely, that would be
worth pursuing.

312
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:10,112
Unique is
a high bar to clear.

313
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:11,998
I'm fully aware of that.

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,449
But if you're not concerned

315
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:15,051
about keeping
your clothes clean,

316
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:18,137
I'm quite confident
this would fit the bill.

317
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:22,291
I did not know
there were tunnels

318
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:23,593
underneath Camden Market.

319
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:24,977
Yeah.

320
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,562
Well, they're closed
to the public,

321
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:28,097
'cause they've got
the unfortunate habit

322
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:30,132
of flooding every
now and again.

323
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,802
I was working on a case
where I was required

324
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:35,938
to spend quite a bit of time
in London's extensive network

325
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,491
of underground tunnels
and catacombs,

326
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:40,610
so, I made my own map.

327
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:45,081
Um, in doing so,
I became convinced there was

328
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,999
a quarter mile of
undocumented tunnel,

329
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,451
which was cut off

330
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:50,319
from its ilk
by the cave-in.

331
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:52,988
Now, there was just
a simple matter

332
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,990
of some unsanctioned
work with dynamite

333
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:58,010
to see if I was
right or not.

334
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:01,547
Here we are.

335
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:04,050
Thank you.

336
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,221
Uh, should you
really be doing that?

337
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,522
It's fine.

338
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:11,023
I put the sign here myself.

339
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:14,811
Can't have spelunkers
poking around there, can we?

340
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,518
Shall we?

341
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,747
What is this place?

342
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:37,250
It's a canal.

343
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,752
It dates back to the...

344
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:42,371
Roman occupation
of Britain.

345
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,894
Those are prayer tablets. See?

346
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:53,266
They're messages from Roman
citizens to their gods.

347
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:55,718
They date back millennia.

348
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,021
Hmm.

349
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:02,325
You and I are the only
two people who know about these.

350
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,734
No!

351
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,422
No!

352
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,343
Irene. Irene.

353
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:22,244
He changed the
rules again.

354
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:25,965
Mr. Stapleton-- he changed the
rules, and he didn't tell me.

355
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,099
Okay.

356
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,551
No! God, no!

357
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,106
I'll get some water.

358
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:38,594
Sherlock...

359
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,813
Come...

360
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:43,282
Come sit with me.

361
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:47,119
Tell me how you've been.

362
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:50,490
What was the last year
and a half of your life like?

363
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:55,110
You moved to New York.

364
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:58,781
There must be a story there.

365
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,134
Hey, I'm back!

366
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:04,787
I should see
if she's learned anything.

367
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,593
How is she?

368
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:12,061
Uh, I don't know.

369
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,462
Maybe a hair better.

370
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:15,130
What news from the front?

371
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:17,483
Well, I learned
that there is such a thing

372
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,685
as a nine-year-old Austrian
real estate tycoon.

373
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:23,472
Other than that, nothing.

374
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:25,140
Hi, Captain.

375
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:27,076
Your gamboge tip paid off.

376
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:30,813
That pigment you found came
from a specialty supply store

377
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:34,166
in Tribeca called
Halcyon Paints.

378
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:37,036
They sold one package of it
in the past few weeks,

379
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,338
to a guy named Duane Proctor.

380
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,873
Did a five-year stretch
a while back

381
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,341
for assault
with a deadly weapon.

382
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:45,127
Do you know where he is?

383
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,495
His PO says he's
been crashing

384
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,014
with his brother
since he got out.

385
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:50,049
We're on our way to talk
to him right now.

386
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,834
Look, I'm sorry,
I just don't think

387
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:53,803
that there's any way Duane
had anything to do with...

388
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,021
What exactly are you
talking about?

389
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:56,606
An abduction?

390
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:58,641
Well, he did do a stint
in Sing Sing, yeah?

391
00:19:58,643 --> 00:20:01,777
Duane has made a genuine effort
to reform himself.

392
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,145
Look, I wouldn't let him stay

393
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:04,530
at the house
if I didn't believe that.

394
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:07,233
- I tutor kids here.
- Captain,

395
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:08,618
he just pulled up.

396
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,237
Sit tight.
Muldoon, stay with him.

397
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,659
Duane Proctor?

398
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:19,245
Captain Gregson, NYPD.

399
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:20,997
What's going on here?

400
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,382
We were wondering if we could
ask you a few questions

401
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:24,700
about Irene Adler.

402
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:27,587
I'm supposed to
know who that is?

403
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:29,204
Yeah, I kind of doubt
you kidnapped her

404
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:30,706
and never asked
her name.

405
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,675
What? What the hell are
you guys talking about?

406
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,093
Hey, don't waste
our time, man.

407
00:20:34,095 --> 00:20:35,511
The paint you bought--
the yellow paint--

408
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:37,096
Irene was using that
when we found her.

409
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:38,681
Yellow paint?

410
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:41,150
Okay, I bought some paint
and brushes and stuff,

411
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:42,885
but I don't know
this Irene whoever.

412
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:44,854
I bought that
stuff for Isaac.

413
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:46,355
My brother.
He's a tutor.

414
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,223
One of his kids
needed some supplies

415
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,109
for an art project
or something...?

416
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:53,296
Stay with him.

417
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,697
Wait, wait, wait.

418
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:56,115
Whoa, whoa.

419
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:57,900
Okay, open, open.

420
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,452
Ho!

421
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:01,504
Detective!

422
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:05,791
Call it in! Call it in!

423
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:08,077
Wait. No, he went out the back!

424
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,546
All right,
just lay down, lay down.

425
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:13,215
Tell 'em to put out
a BOLO for Isaac Proctor.

426
00:21:13,217 --> 00:21:16,268
We came looking
for the wrong brother.

427
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:24,175
I don't know why
my brother did what he did.

428
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,273
I didn't even know he had a gun.

429
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,058
We found a small arsenal

430
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,910
in that locker
in his garage.

431
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,862
He had guns,
silencers,

432
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,697
passports under
three different names.

433
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:36,166
And I am just as confused
about this as you are.

434
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,951
My brother was the good one.
He was the smart one.

435
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:39,286
Before he was tutoring kids,

436
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:40,671
he worked in a freakin'
think tank.

437
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:43,674
He ever mention a guy
named Moriarty?

438
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:46,343
We went to high school
with a guy named Maury Goldberg.

439
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:49,296
No. It's one name--
a last name.

440
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:51,715
Moriarty.

441
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:54,384
Isaac never mentioned him.

442
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:57,287
If he did, I would tell you.

443
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:59,422
I don't want to go back
to prison, man.

444
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,391
I'm sorry.
I don't know his face,

445
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:03,360
and I don't know his voice.

446
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:06,897
If he ever came to the house
I was in, I don't remember it.

447
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:09,983
What about his brother...

448
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:12,152
Isaac?

449
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:16,323
I'm sorry. I-I just can't tell.

450
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,408
It's okay.

451
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,378
It's brave of you
to just come down.

452
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,381
If that's all there is,
I think we'd best be going.

453
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:25,999
Yeah, come on, hm?

454
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,450
Okay.

455
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,957
It's weird to see him
walk away from a case.

456
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,476
I mean, don't-don't
get me wrong; I get it.

457
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:38,011
It's just weird.

458
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:41,431
Well, how's the detective
doing that got shot?

459
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,233
Six broken ribs,

460
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:44,484
punctured lung.

461
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:46,770
He's lucky he was
wearing his vest.

462
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:49,656
He's lucky the perp decided
to shoot him there.

463
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,825
The weapons we found
were modified.

464
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,160
They had suppressors.

465
00:22:53,162 --> 00:22:56,363
Tells me Isaac
Proctor is a pro.

466
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:58,648
He could've
killed Muldoon

467
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,283
if he chose to.

468
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:03,003
So what now?
We keep digging

469
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:05,288
into Isaac's background,
see if we can't connect him

470
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,240
to Holmes's pal.

471
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:09,176
In the meantime,
his picture's still out there.

472
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:12,713
It's not much,
but it's where we start.

473
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:24,941
Ten messages
before you call me back?

474
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:27,477
I had to explain
your situation to Moriarty.

475
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:29,863
It took some time
to make contact.

476
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:32,783
How did the police find you?
I don't have any idea.

477
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:34,851
Look, my face is
all over the news--

478
00:23:34,853 --> 00:23:36,319
can you help me or not?

479
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:37,654
Of course we can.

480
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:39,522
But we need you
to run an errand.

481
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:41,708
It involves Sherlock Holmes.

482
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,881
...was rocked by scandal
for the secon...

483
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:49,549
...taken to hospital but...

484
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:52,285
...National
Hockey League featured a busy...

485
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,389
You're doing that now? Really?

486
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,007
We've just had sex.

487
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,726
My brain is awash
with neurochemicals.

488
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:02,729
This is a particularly
vexing case.

489
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,066
"M."
Mm.

490
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:08,068
I still can't determine
the method

491
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,021
with which he chooses
his victims.

492
00:24:11,023 --> 00:24:13,723
But the only consistency...

493
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:16,493
is the means
by which he executes them.

494
00:24:16,495 --> 00:24:19,746
He hangs their bodies
from a tripod device, like this,

495
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:21,031
and then...

496
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:23,250
Drains their blood. I remember.
Yeah.

497
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:25,735
Is this all I am now?

498
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:28,071
A piece of exercise
equipment for your brain?

499
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:29,840
You're the greatest piece
of exercise equipment

500
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:32,292
a man could ever hope
to throw a leg over.

501
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:34,845
That's Keats, right?

502
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,131
You're right.

503
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:40,684
I'm being terribly rude.

504
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,853
Yes, but you're
typically quite rude.

505
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:46,756
I'm trying to figure out
why it doesn't bother me.

506
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:49,643
'Cause you're rude.

507
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:51,594
Well, I mean, you're...

508
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:52,996
you're honest.

509
00:24:52,998 --> 00:24:54,648
Simple minds he always

510
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,535
confused great honesty
with great rudeness.

511
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:05,659
Mmm...

512
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:09,612
You know I'm not releasing
any more neurochemicals, right?

513
00:25:09,614 --> 00:25:11,498
You know...

514
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,467
these... these birthmarks,

515
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:17,120
they are... almost
exactly the same shape

516
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:19,389
as the constellation Auriga.

517
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:22,692
Is that a good
thing or bad?

518
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:24,294
Well, it's... I'm just...

519
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:26,963
I'm surprised I've
never noticed before.

520
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:30,734
Even after all this time,
you're something of a...

521
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:33,436
blind spot to me.

522
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:36,323
You say the sweetest things.

523
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:39,993
I like that
I don't see everything.

524
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:42,028
It's rare.

525
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:47,701
By the way, I've been
meaning to ask you, um,

526
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:49,836
why haven't you told me
about your new project?

527
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:52,622
We talked about the Rubens
the other day.

528
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:54,925
No. The other new project.

529
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:56,492
Well, the Rubens has

530
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:59,662
a very... very
particular palette.

531
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:02,799
The last few times we've met,
you've had flecks of paint

532
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:05,185
of very different colors
on your hands.

533
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:06,937
Also, the guest bedroom's

534
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:10,140
been locked the last
few times I've been here,

535
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:12,726
which leads me
to believe

536
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:15,511
that is where
the new work resides.

537
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:17,814
So...

538
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:20,650
could it be
an Irene Adler original?

539
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:24,187
'Cause I distinctly
remember you saying

540
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:27,157
that you had absolutely nothing
to contribute to the medium.

541
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,875
That was months ago.

542
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:31,861
I feel differently now.

543
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:33,696
What's changed?

544
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:38,835
I really just...
I'd like to take a look at it.

545
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:41,388
You'll see it when it's ready.

546
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,877
♪

547
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:52,015
Why did you come here?

548
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:55,819
Can I get you anything?

549
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:58,221
I'm fine, thanks.

550
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:04,911
This must be
difficult for you.

551
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:08,331
Sorry?

552
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,917
Having me here.

553
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,122
I know how much
you... see.

554
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:20,076
I can only imagine what you
must be picking up right now.

555
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:24,764
You know, you're the only person
I ever empathized with.

556
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:26,433
Empathy.

557
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,468
You have changed.

558
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:34,090
You asked me
the other day

559
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:36,860
what my life's
been like.

560
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,531
Um...

561
00:27:43,402 --> 00:27:47,737
You may recall, over the course
of our relationship, that I...

562
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:51,491
dabbled with
the occasional narcotic.

563
00:27:51,493 --> 00:27:53,994
They were a hobby, and...

564
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:56,997
after your demise they became...

565
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,965
a good deal more than that.

566
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,467
Yeah.

567
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,836
A way of life, really.

568
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:04,754
Sherlock...
I was...

569
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:07,557
I was broken. I was...

570
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,976
I thought the drugs
were helping,

571
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:12,145
and they were not.

572
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:15,765
When I couldn't find the man
who I thought had killed you,

573
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,183
I-I just...

574
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:19,019
I hit a bottom.

575
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:23,473
Scotland Yard asked me
to step aside.

576
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:26,443
I ended up coming here
to New York to hide.

577
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:30,080
When my father realized the
depths to which I had sunk,

578
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:32,983
he forced me into rehab.

579
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:35,118
You're better now.

580
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,455
I'm sober now.

581
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:41,708
I'll always be an addict.

582
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:48,698
I'm sorry, I, uh, I would
like to be able to say that I...

583
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,433
honored your memory.

584
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:53,169
In fact, I did
quite the opposite.

585
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:56,523
Please know that I hold
myself 100% accountable

586
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,591
for everything that
has happened to you.

587
00:28:58,593 --> 00:29:00,128
It is unlikely
that I will ever be able

588
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:01,738
to make that up to you...

589
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:07,334
but you have my word that
I will never stop trying.

590
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:10,637
You were broken.

591
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,456
You fixed yourself.

592
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:16,359
If the great
Sherlock Holmes

593
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:18,028
can do it, then...

594
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:22,849
...you give me hope.

595
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,611
He was here.

596
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:54,230
Mr. Stapleton was here.

597
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:07,598
Sherlock, it's ready.

598
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,218
My original piece
is finally ready,

599
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,837
and you have an exclusive
invitation to view it.

600
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:15,273
I'm out of town
for a few more days

601
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:16,791
but will return on Friday.

602
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:18,893
Meet me at my place by 5:00,

603
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:21,846
or into the fireplace it goes.

604
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:27,201
Hello?

605
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:31,856
I realize I'm late, but I have
the most dazzling of excuses.

606
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:54,011
I thought you were taking me
someplace safe.

607
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,046
This is an old garage.

608
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:59,267
I assure you it's a good
deal more than that.

609
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,937
Come on.

610
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:06,724
I received this property as...

611
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:08,359
payment...

612
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:11,529
for some work I did when
I first arrived in New York.

613
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:13,898
Had intended to sell it...

614
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,167
but then I realized...

615
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:20,171
it might make a
passable safe house...

616
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,850
in case of emergency.

617
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,709
Are you sure we
weren't followed?

618
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,677
I'm positive.
I followed

619
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,579
every countersurveillance
procedure known to man,

620
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:31,215
and then some known
only to me, so...

621
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:33,301
I promise you, you're
quite safe here.

622
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:36,003
What about your house?
Shouldn't we call the police?

623
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:37,654
Well, I have done,
after a fashion--

624
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,824
I've texted Watson.

625
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,942
She's handling it.

626
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:44,929
The scene will be...
processed.

627
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:46,764
It doesn't make any sense.

628
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:49,934
This... Moriarty,
he let me go.

629
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:52,153
He told you were to find me,
so why would his people

630
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:54,772
leave that flower on my pillow.
It was a message, obviously.

631
00:31:54,774 --> 00:31:56,440
Why would he
send me a message?

632
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,776
The message was for me.

633
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:00,962
It could not have
been clearer.

634
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:03,164
He wants me
to understand

635
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,430
that as long as you're
in my life,

636
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,121
you can and
will be used against me.

637
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:11,088
You are one of the strongest
people I have ever met,

638
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,291
but next to a will and
a mind like Moriarty,

639
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,960
you're weak.

640
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:19,347
And because I care for
you... I'm also weak.

641
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,434
That's why I need
to let you go.

642
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:25,903
What?

643
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:29,440
I'm sorry,
you can't stay here.

644
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:31,609
We need to send you...

645
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:33,361
far away.

646
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:37,248
Somewhere you can
really be safe.

647
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,317
When I have finished
with Moriarty,

648
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,037
I'll come find you.

649
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,991
You make it sound
so easy.

650
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:55,850
The notion of causing you
additional hardship...

651
00:32:55,852 --> 00:33:00,021
it pains me to my core.

652
00:33:00,023 --> 00:33:02,056
Sherlock...

653
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:04,692
I'm afraid.

654
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:06,777
And we've only just
found each other again

655
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,647
after all this time.

656
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:11,699
I see no other way

657
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:14,018
to protect you.

658
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,959
What if I see another way?

659
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,646
Isaac Proctor.

660
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:27,548
He changed his look,
but that's him.

661
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,199
If there was ever any doubt
he was connected

662
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:31,002
to what happened
to Ms. Adler,

663
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:32,570
there isn't anymore.

664
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:34,538
We got all the cameras out
of your brownstone, right?

665
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,223
Um, all the ones
he told me about.

666
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,676
I mean, this doesn't
make any sense.

667
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:41,062
I mean, why go to
all this trouble?

668
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,980
Why mess with Irene's head?
I mean,

669
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:44,849
all the evidence says
that Isaac Proctor

670
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:47,651
is a professional,
not a psychopath.

671
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,820
I got to figure he's still
following orders, right?

672
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:52,556
Right. Have you heard
from Holmes yet?

673
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:54,391
I left him three messages
and a few texts.

674
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:55,659
Captain.

675
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,895
Got Holmes for you on line one.
Okay.

676
00:33:57,897 --> 00:34:00,498
About time. Thank you.

677
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,234
Holmes, where
the hell are you?

678
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:07,838
Hello? Hello?

679
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,741
Why didn't
he call my cell?

680
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,010
Maybe he'll call you back.
Um, I'm gonna get a coffee.

681
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:14,545
Does anyone want anything?

682
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:16,464
No. No, thank you.

683
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,750
Where's Irene?

684
00:34:19,752 --> 00:34:21,752
Safe.

685
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:24,305
You want to explain
all the cloak and dagger?

686
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:27,341
I trust Captain Gregson and
Detective Bell implicitly.

687
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:29,760
But given the scope of
Moriarty's operation,

688
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:31,695
the fewer people who know
about my whereabouts the better.

689
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:35,232
Well, a few things you need
to be caught up on.

690
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:37,267
Remember when Duane Proctor
said his brother

691
00:34:37,269 --> 00:34:38,936
worked at a think tank?

692
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:40,154
We looked into it.

693
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:42,039
Turns out it's really
a CIA front.

694
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,075
So Isaac Proctor worked for them
as an interrogator

695
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:46,544
in the late '90s--
his specialty was psychological

696
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:47,928
pressure tactics.

697
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,797
You think we may have found
our Mr. Stapleton?

698
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:51,098
I know we have.

699
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,000
Isaac was the one
who left the flower

700
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:54,418
on Irene's pillow tonight.

701
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,087
We caught him on one
of your security cameras.

702
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,388
And I noticed something--

703
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,390
he came in
through the kitchen door

704
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:01,308
and made a beeline
for Irene's room.

705
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,227
He knew exactly
where she was staying.

706
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,062
How could he know that?

707
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:06,931
You think that Moriarty
has-has cameras

708
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:09,066
in our house, too?
Mm. I suppose with a man like him,

709
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:10,651
anything is possible.
What do you mean you suppose?

710
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:11,769
We need
to figure this out.

711
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:14,655
I'm leaving New York, Watson.

712
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:15,990
What?

713
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:18,976
I told Irene that,
in order to be safe,

714
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:20,361
she needed to go elsewhere.

715
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:22,312
She said she would only do so

716
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:25,032
if I accompanied her, so...

717
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:27,535
I came to say good-bye.

718
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:29,186
I don't understand.

719
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:30,988
How-how long will you be gone?

720
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,823
That's difficult
to say.

721
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:35,793
If you could dismantle
Moriarty's empire in my absence,

722
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,294
thereby guaranteeing
Irene's safety,

723
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:40,131
that would go a long way
to expediting my return.

724
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:42,766
Is this what you want or is this
what you think you owe?

725
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,768
I don't think I owe anything.
I know it.

726
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,805
Her life was ruined
because of me.

727
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:49,506
We are on
to something here.

728
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,775
We can find Isaac Proctor
and that might

729
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:54,011
lead us to Moriarty.
I'm sorry, Watson.

730
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:55,696
My mind is made up.

731
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:57,364
This is what
Moriarty wants,

732
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:00,117
and if it's what he wants,
it's a mistake.

733
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,232
Were you followed?
No.

734
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:37,488
The plates are clean.
There's $30,000 and a phone

735
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,057
in the glove compartment.
You drive to Calgary,

736
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:41,892
and you wait.

737
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:44,561
The next instructions you're
gonna get are on the burner,

738
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:46,997
so... stay close to it.

739
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,667
Will I be allowed to call home?

740
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:56,006
Think this through.

741
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,408
If you kill me...
Shut up.

742
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:03,413
"Call home."

743
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:05,599
You voice-activated one phone
to call the other.

744
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,251
Metal drum in the trunk.

745
00:37:07,253 --> 00:37:09,720
You were gonna use it
to get rid of my body.

746
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:11,305
Whose idea?

747
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:12,940
You were sloppy.

748
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:14,108
The police should
never have been able

749
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,976
to trace that house
back to you,

750
00:37:15,978 --> 00:37:17,261
but they did.

751
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:19,196
Moriarty can't abide that.

752
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:21,782
Moriarty thinks
I was sloppy?

753
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:24,485
Who left standing orders never
to hurt Sherlock Holmes?

754
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:26,253
Only reason you're
still breathing

755
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:28,706
is so you can report back.

756
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,658
Moriarty's obsessed with Holmes.

757
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,326
Doesn't want him touched.

758
00:37:32,328 --> 00:37:34,161
You tell Moriarty

759
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:37,831
that Sherlock Holmes
is a dead man.

760
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:42,953
Irene?

761
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:45,506
I didn't think
you'd be gone so long.

762
00:37:45,508 --> 00:37:47,291
I've been busy.

763
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:50,344
We have a way out.

764
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:52,629
No one will know
that we've gone.

765
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:54,732
And they won't know
how to find us...

766
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,267
once they do.

767
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,602
There's a Greyhound to Maine.

768
00:37:58,604 --> 00:38:01,488
I have a friend there
who can get us some passports.

769
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,691
Then the trick will be
conscripting a boat

770
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:05,142
to take us to Newfoundland.

771
00:38:05,144 --> 00:38:06,277
Once we're at
St. John's Airport,

772
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:07,477
virtually any
destination...

773
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:10,247
What?

774
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,199
Is that as far as you've gotten?

775
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,034
It's all right.

776
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:17,254
We don't need to have every move
mapped out 20 steps in advance.

777
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,923
We can work it out as we...

778
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,377
Sherlock?

779
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:24,962
What the hell
are you doing?

780
00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:27,514
Get off of me!

781
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,301
Why would you do that?

782
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:32,853
How...

783
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,105
How could I have been so stupid?

784
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:38,525
Sherlock, you're scaring me.

785
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:40,861
How long have you been
working for him?

786
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:42,146
What?

787
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:43,147
Moriarty.

788
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:44,514
How long...

789
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:46,066
have you been working...

790
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:47,701
for Moriarty?

791
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:50,621
You're not making any sense.
Your constellation,

792
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:53,107
Auriga...

793
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:56,026
One of the stars is missing.
What?

794
00:38:56,028 --> 00:38:59,046
Your birthmarks. You-you've had
one surgically removed.

795
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,365
I don't know what...

796
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:03,533
Your birthmarks!

797
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:09,056
Was it, was it,
was it precancerous, huh?

798
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:11,809
So you had it removed.

799
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:15,095
You had it removed, not
Moriarty, because why would he?

800
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,064
Why would he care?

801
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:18,599
Hmm?

802
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:22,052
When did it start?

803
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:27,024
When... did it start?

804
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:29,360
Was it before
your abduction?

805
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:31,728
Was everything a lie?!

806
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,530
I've never lied to you.

807
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:35,949
You get like this.
You get like this.

808
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:38,068
You look at a thing
so closely

809
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,238
you start to see things
that aren't there.

810
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,624
You know you do.

811
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:47,077
If you can't trust anyone,

812
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:49,913
if you can't trust me...

813
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:52,416
please...

814
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:55,886
don't do this.

815
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:59,440
Watson asked me.
She said... she said...

816
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:03,560
she says how is it
that Isaac Proctor knew

817
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:07,147
exactly which was your room
in the brownstone.

818
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:09,366
And now we know.

819
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:12,602
Because you told Moriarty.

820
00:40:12,604 --> 00:40:13,937
You lied before.

821
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:15,939
You don't really want
to come with me,

822
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:18,325
so you're inventing
a reason not to.

823
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:21,462
You know...

824
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:23,464
it's funny.

825
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:26,216
I close my eyes
and I try to picture him,

826
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:29,887
and I see someone
an awful lot like you.

827
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:33,841
I think you do, too.

828
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:35,676
I think if you
weren't so bent

829
00:40:35,678 --> 00:40:37,845
on being your enemy,

830
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:40,063
he'd be your friend.

831
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:46,487
When you realize the
mistake you've made,

832
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:48,689
don't try and find me.

833
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:53,026
I don't ever want
to see you again.

Watson, change of plan.
I'm not going anywhere.

838
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,434
There's much we need to discuss.
I've returned

839
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:33,286
to the brown...

840
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,407
I apologize, Mr. Holmes.

841
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:40,076
You weren't supposed
to see it coming.

842
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:42,545
Mr. Proctor.

843
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:44,664
I was wondering when I was going
to make your acquaintance.

844
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,549
Actually,

845
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:47,750
we met once before...

846
00:42:20,534 --> 00:42:22,535
You know you're only
prolonging the inevitable.

847
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:25,338
You said
we've met before, but...

848
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
I never forget a face.

849
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:28,841
I had you at a disadvantage.

850
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:31,160
I was looking at you
through a sniper scope.

851
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:34,497
So why kill me now?

852
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:36,516
Not then?

853
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:45,608
I was under orders
that day.

854
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,643
Moriarty said you weren't
to be harmed.

855
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:50,997
But then, a few hours ago,
she tried to have me killed.

856
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:53,115
"She"?

857
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,385
Bet you wish
you'd run away with me

858
00:43:12,387 --> 00:43:14,603
when you had the chance.

859
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,673
Moriarty.

860
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:30,693
This isn't how-- or when--

861
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,762
I wanted to reveal myself
to you.

862
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:36,999
But Mr. Proctor
forced the issue.

863
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,486
This is a ruse.

864
00:43:40,488 --> 00:43:43,706
You...

865
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:49,512
So who was the man
I spoke to on the phone,

866
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:51,663
who, uh...
said he was Moriarty?

867
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:53,899
You talked to
one of my lieutenants.

868
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:55,935
He has, over the years,
played the role repeatedly

869
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:57,553
and with great conviction.

870
00:43:57,555 --> 00:43:59,004
More often than not,
he's done so

871
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:00,806
to protect my identity.

872
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:02,775
Other times, it was
because I suspected

873
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:07,646
a potential client might...
struggle... with my gender.

874
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:10,282
As if men had
a monopoly on murder.

875
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,405
What if I don't believe you?

876
00:44:16,407 --> 00:44:18,857
You don't want to believe me.

877
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:21,460
And yet your legendary
powers of observation

878
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:24,380
are screaming that I'm telling
the truth right now.

879
00:44:24,382 --> 00:44:26,165
Why would you do this?

880
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:29,368
Seduce me, and...

881
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,554
lead me to believe
that you'd been murdered?

882
00:44:31,556 --> 00:44:34,507
You're the detective, Sherlock.
You tell me.

883
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:36,392
Well, I must have interrupted
one of your plans

884
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:38,477
when I was still working
at Scotland Yard.

885
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,696
Try several plans.

886
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:43,733
A series of assassinations

887
00:44:43,735 --> 00:44:46,352
I'd planned meticulously.

888
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:48,404
Punishment, then.

889
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:50,906
My first instinct
was to kill you.

890
00:44:50,908 --> 00:44:52,724
Quietly.

891
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:54,193
Discreetly.

892
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:59,498
But then, the more
I learned about you,

893
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,233
the more curious I became.

894
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:04,170
Here, at last,

895
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:07,339
seemed to be a mind that...
that rivaled my own,

896
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:10,593
something too complicated
and too beautiful to destroy...

897
00:45:10,595 --> 00:45:13,129
at least without
further analysis.

898
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:18,300
So I devised a way
to study you...

899
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:19,969
in your own environment.

900
00:45:22,939 --> 00:45:25,691
You became "Irene""

901
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:26,892
Imagine my surprise

902
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,861
when I realized
how much we had in common.

903
00:45:28,863 --> 00:45:30,379
I have about as much
in common with you

904
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:31,647
as I do a dung beetle.

905
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:34,099
I can understand
why you would think so.

906
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:38,871
I know how much pride you take
in your uniqueness.

907
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:42,908
But the truth is,
I see everything you do.

908
00:45:44,277 --> 00:45:45,544
I feel it.

909
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:48,414
Makes the world
quite dull, no?

910
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:50,249
Looking at a man,

911
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:52,001
and knowing
all his secrets.

912
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:53,419
So you're saying
we're the same.

913
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:55,954
I'm saying I'm better.

914
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,461
And that's why I let you live,
back in London.

915
00:46:02,463 --> 00:46:05,764
You were not the threat
you had been made out to be.

916
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:09,485
So I concluded my experiment
and resumed my business.

917
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:12,304
You proceeded to prove
you were inferior

918
00:46:12,306 --> 00:46:14,607
by disappearing into a syringe.

919
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,075
Hmm.

920
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,862
Why resurface in New York?

921
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,748
I'd heard of your...

922
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,368
your miraculous recovery,
and I...

923
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,871
I was curious to see
how far you'd come.

924
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,657
That's bollocks.

925
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:33,992
Returning to me is a risk,
and you'd only take it

926
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:38,681
if I was close to undermining
another of your plots.

927
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:40,716
That is why you wanted me
to lea the country

928
00:46:40,718 --> 00:46:42,301
with you earlier,
was it not?

929
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:44,770
Same old Sherlock.

930
00:46:44,772 --> 00:46:46,805
You look at people
and you see puzzles.

931
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:50,109
I see games.

932
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,360
You?

933
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:54,029
You're a game
I'll win every time.

934
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:57,900
You might as well just
kill me now, 'cause...

935
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:01,687
whatever it is
you came here to do...

936
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:03,239
I'll stop you.

937
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:05,324
I would never kill you.

938
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:10,195
Not in a million years.

939
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:12,665
You may not be as unique
as you thought, darling,

940
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,133
but you're still a work of art.

941
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:15,668
I appreciate art.

942
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,805
What I-I can do...

943
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,341
what I will do...

944
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:28,547
...is hurt you.

945
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:32,101
Worse than I did before.

946
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:37,823
I have reserves of creativity
I haven't even begun to tap.

947
00:47:37,825 --> 00:47:40,326
So please...

948
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:42,828
for you own good...

949
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,232
...let me win.

950
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:08,137
Watson, you're here.

951
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:09,421
Excellent.

952
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:11,757
There's so much
I need to tell you.

953
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:13,025
This is stupid.

954
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:14,977
You should be
in the hospital right now.

955
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,396
Told you there isn't time.

956
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:19,431
Besides, what's the point of
living with a former surgeon

957
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,450
if she can't stitch the
occasional bullet hole?

958
00:48:21,452 --> 00:48:23,619
The muscle in your shoulder
is shredded, okay?

959
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:25,321
You need to be treated
for the pain.

960
00:48:25,323 --> 00:48:28,374
May I remind you I am
a recovering drug addict?

961
00:48:28,376 --> 00:48:30,042
May I remind you that
there is such a thing

962
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:31,493
as non-addictive painkillers?

963
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,162
How good can they be
if they're non-addictive?

964
00:48:33,164 --> 00:48:34,463
Anyway...

965
00:48:34,465 --> 00:48:35,798
if I'm gonna deduce

966
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,549
what Irene is up to
in New York,

967
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:39,969
I'm gonna need every
last one of my faculties.

968
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:44,807
I'm sorry about Irene.

969
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:47,125
Or... Moriarty--
whatever her name is.

970
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:50,312
I actually found the truth
quite liberating.

971
00:48:50,314 --> 00:48:51,930
I've wanted the answers
to Irene's murder

972
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:53,465
for a long time.

973
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:55,267
Now I have them.

974
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:58,237
And she erred when she revealed
herself to me this morning.

975
00:48:58,239 --> 00:48:59,855
Thanks to her...

976
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:02,808
I now have perfect clarity.

977
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:05,844
You've never seen me
with perfect clarity.

978
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:07,746
Okay.

979
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,450
Irene is Moriarty.

980
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:13,669
You think she's here
to do something terrible.

981
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:15,987
You have a hole
in your shoulder,

982
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:19,091
and we have a dead assassin
on the third floor of our home.

983
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:23,161
So, where would you
like to start?

984
00:49:29,168 --> 00:49:32,354
So Isaac Proctor shot you.

985
00:49:32,356 --> 00:49:34,490
And then your ex-girlfriend
shot him.

986
00:49:34,492 --> 00:49:37,276
Except...
Irene's not really Irene.

987
00:49:37,278 --> 00:49:39,978
She's, uh, some kind of...

988
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,314
what, mastermind?

989
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,485
Very good, Captain.
You have it all straight.

990
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:45,351
I can't believe

991
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,903
I'm-I'm saying this,
but I'll tell our people

992
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:51,356
to be on the lookout for--
I guess Irene Adler

993
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:53,409
is an alias.
Well, she goes by Moriarty,

994
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:55,794
but we're not sure
if that's her real name.

995
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,830
It's all very well
to be on the lookout,

996
00:49:57,832 --> 00:49:59,030
but you're dealing with someone

997
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,133
who is capable
of meticulous planning

998
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:04,136
and extremes of self-discipline.
If you do find her,

999
00:50:04,138 --> 00:50:06,672
the only crime she's committed
is shooting that man,

1000
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:08,724
who was... shooting me.

1001
00:50:08,726 --> 00:50:10,309
So where do we start looking?

1002
00:50:10,311 --> 00:50:12,261
I don't know.

1003
00:50:12,263 --> 00:50:14,480
But if we're gonna learn,
we need to determine

1004
00:50:14,482 --> 00:50:16,682
what she's been doing
in New York the past few weeks.

1005
00:50:16,684 --> 00:50:19,268
At the moment, all we have
are pieces of what appears to be

1006
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,052
a larger plan.

1007
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:22,604
The scheme to take over
the Taggart Speakeasy,

1008
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:23,906
the arrest of the principal of

1009
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:25,524
Sutter Risk Management
for murder,

1010
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:28,193
but so far none of it adds
up to a coherent whole.

1011
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:32,397
We're not gonna learn much
from Isaac Proctor's body.

1012
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:34,666
If Irene-- oh--

1013
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:38,236
I suppose I should get used
to calling her... Moriarty--

1014
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:41,757
she took his phone
and his wallet.

1015
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:43,092
Hmm.

1016
00:50:43,094 --> 00:50:45,377
Did you find something?

1017
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,298
Who-Who-Whose items are these?

1018
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,850
Couple of homicide victims
that came in last night.

1019
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:53,969
Uh, one of them's
got Cyrillic tats.

1020
00:50:54,854 --> 00:50:56,588
We think
it's gang-related.

1021
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,890
Why?

1022
00:50:57,892 --> 00:50:59,308
These cell phones.

1023
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,927
They've been modified
so someone could install

1024
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,729
an open-source
operating system

1025
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,981
in lieu of the one
that the phone comes with.

1026
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:09,660
We've seen this kind
of modification twice recently.

1027
00:51:09,661 --> 00:51:11,621
Sebastian Moran,
Daniel Gottlieb.

1028
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:14,123
Every time we deal
with one of Moriarty's people,

1029
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,825
someone's done the same kind
of jailbreak on their phone.

1030
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,294
I don't think those deaths
are gang-related.

1031
00:51:19,296 --> 00:51:22,965
I think this man was
in open warfare with Moriarty.

1032
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,750
He's your killer.

1033
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,117
Oh, hold on.

1034
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,187
All that we got
is two cell phones.

1035
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:30,288
We don't have any
proof that those guys

1036
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,641
were-were working
for Moriarty.

1037
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:34,977
Yes, we do.

1038
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:36,178
That's the same code

1039
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,230
on Moran and Gottlieb's phone.

1040
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:41,767
It's a code that I know
how to break.

1041
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:47,022
"B... N... 2... 3""

1042
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:51,142
"Macedonian Sun"?

1043
00:51:51,144 --> 00:51:52,361
What does that mean?

1044
00:51:52,363 --> 00:51:53,912
Haven't the foggiest.

1045
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:56,147
But it's nice
to have a handhold.

1046
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:08,427
See, to me, it seems simple.

1047
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:12,264
I mean, Holmes just found out
he's been manipulated for years.

1048
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:14,216
Guy's got to
be devastated.

1049
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:17,769
Plus, he's refusing medical
attention for a gunshot wound?

1050
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:20,772
I mean, I understand
he's invested in the case,

1051
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:23,508
but the NYPD doesn't
do vendettas.

1052
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:26,812
If he was one of my detectives,
I'd bench him.

1053
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:28,780
Look, I understand
why you're worried,

1054
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:30,399
but if he can't look for Irene,

1055
00:52:30,401 --> 00:52:32,284
if he has to marinate
in his mistakes--

1056
00:52:32,286 --> 00:52:35,120
I think I know him
pretty well by now--

1057
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:38,957
that could be the one thing
that pushes him over the edge.

1058
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:42,527
If I think
he needs to stop,

1059
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:45,631
I'll tell you.

1060
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:50,302
I know what it means.

1061
00:52:50,304 --> 00:52:51,803
The message.

1062
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:54,890
The Macedonian Sun
is a container ship

1063
00:52:54,892 --> 00:52:56,708
licensed to operate out
of Bay 23 North

1064
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,644
at the Port of New York
and New Jersey.

1065
00:52:58,646 --> 00:53:01,146
It is part of a fleet
of Hellenic Exporters,

1066
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:02,764
which is a company owned by...

1067
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:05,584
Christos Theophilus.

1068
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:07,102
Oh, well,
I've heard that name.

1069
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:09,187
Perhaps you remember him best
by his nickname...

1070
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:11,890
the Narwhal.
Narwhal.

1071
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:14,059
Like the whale with
a horn on its head?

1072
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:15,494
Yes, precisely.

1073
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:18,163
Now, during the late '80s,
early '90s,

1074
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:21,700
Interpol believed that he was
one of Europe's most prolific

1075
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,735
maritime smugglers,
but he was elusive--

1076
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:26,588
they could never, in fact,
prove that he was... a criminal.

1077
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:29,341
Now, by all accounts, he dropped
out of the smuggling trade

1078
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:32,410
some time ago and has since
remade himself as the...

1079
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:33,762
the legitimate head

1080
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:35,547
of an international
shipping conglomerate

1081
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:39,301
and a noted contributor
to Greek nationalist charities.

1082
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:40,802
So you're wondering

1083
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,604
if he really remade himself

1084
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:43,922
or if he's working for Moriarty.

1085
00:53:43,924 --> 00:53:45,440
He has hundreds of boats

1086
00:53:45,442 --> 00:53:47,442
circumnavigating the globe
at any given time.

1087
00:53:47,444 --> 00:53:49,144
He would be a very useful

1088
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:52,030
partner to an international
arranger of assassinations.

1089
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:53,899
He could move personnel,
weaponry

1090
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:55,600
with little chance of detection.

1091
00:53:55,602 --> 00:53:59,955
Now, the Macedonian Sun is due
in port this very evening.

1092
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,161
I think
it's been a while

1093
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:07,629
since a few of us have eaten.

1094
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:09,298
There's a roach coach
a couple blocks away.

1095
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,449
I'm gonna get some burgers.
You want anything?

1096
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:14,285
Coffee, please.

1097
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,391
How you doing?

1098
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:25,130
I mean, all the stuff
you're dealing with,

1099
00:54:25,132 --> 00:54:27,983
it's next level.

1100
00:54:27,985 --> 00:54:29,651
You know, to think
that that lady

1101
00:54:29,653 --> 00:54:32,270
would mess with your head,
to this degree...

1102
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:36,575
I know it must seem strange.

1103
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:39,494
But, uh, tell you the truth...

1104
00:54:39,496 --> 00:54:43,782
I've come to believe it might
be a good thing in the long run.

1105
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:45,584
Good thing?
Yeah.

1106
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:49,037
Must be some interesting
math you're doing.

1107
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,342
Well, I've never had
a nemesis before.

1108
00:54:53,344 --> 00:54:56,211
Not a proper one.

1109
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:59,765
Quite looking forward to it.

1110
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:03,935
I imagine it to be
tremendously energizing.

1111
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:13,178
Hey, the ship's
unloaded.

1112
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,230
We didn't see
anything unusual,

1113
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:18,483
so we were thinking
maybe time to go home.

1114
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,203
Yes, I understand.

1115
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:22,954
There are lives to return to.

1116
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:25,690
I will keep vigil here
on my own till morning.

1117
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:28,359
Hold up.
Look at that.

1118
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:45,343
The Narwhal himself. This is it.

1119
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:47,429
Whatever that boat
has brought for Moriarty,

1120
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:50,232
that man is here to pick it up.

1121
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:55,854
NYPD!

1122
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:01,559
Don't move! Don't move!

1123
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,329
This is my boat.
What are you doing?

1124
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:06,581
You just unloaded
a smuggled crate from it.

1125
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:08,784
I want to see
what's inside.

1126
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:26,251
You said Moriarty
might be using that boat

1127
00:56:26,253 --> 00:56:28,419
to smuggle weapons or personnel.

1128
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:30,755
Tell me which one
these two are.

1129
00:56:46,584 --> 00:56:48,735
I've never in my life heard
the name Moriarty.

1130
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:50,070
Narwal, stop lying to us.

1131
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:52,039
You know, my client
has asked several times

1132
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,907
that you not refer
to him as "Narwhal."

1133
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:55,709
I don't know why
it bothers him.

1134
00:56:55,711 --> 00:56:57,845
They're lovely creatures--
the unicorns of the sea.

1135
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,097
It bothers me because
it's a name from another time.

1136
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:02,800
- I am not that man.
- Not a smuggler?

1137
00:57:02,802 --> 00:57:04,918
It's an interesting position,
considering we just caught you

1138
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,016
smuggling two lemurs
into the country.

1139
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:09,841
Okay, look,
my daughter, Alethea--

1140
00:57:09,842 --> 00:57:12,109
animals are near
and dear to her,

1141
00:57:12,111 --> 00:57:14,862
and she married a man
who feels the same way.

1142
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,965
They've been getting more and
more involved in conservation,

1143
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:22,069
and me-- I'm just a man
who can't say no to his kid.

1144
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,938
You're telling me those
lemurs are for your daughter?

1145
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,458
They were poached,

1146
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,609
and they were being
auctioned off

1147
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:31,962
to men who would
strip them of parts

1148
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:34,614
like an old car.

1149
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:40,087
My girl and her husband--

1150
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:42,422
they live on a horse ranch
in Westchester.

1151
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:44,641
They will take good care
of them.

1152
00:57:44,643 --> 00:57:46,059
So, you're running

1153
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:47,478
an underground railroad

1154
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,595
for endangered species?

1155
00:57:48,597 --> 00:57:50,481
Can your daughter

1156
00:57:50,483 --> 00:57:51,565
corroborate all this?

1157
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:53,484
She is on vacation in Kenya.

1158
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:56,136
But her husband
is out there.

1159
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:58,138
He will show you.

1160
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,240
Well... it's gonna
take a while

1161
00:58:00,242 --> 00:58:02,809
to get out to Westchester
this time of day.

1162
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:04,444
I'm gonna call ahead
to the local cops,

1163
00:58:04,446 --> 00:58:06,029
let 'em know
we're coming.

1164
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:08,315
I assume this is a call
you can make while driving.

1165
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,150
We are not going anywhere
until we change your bandage.

1166
00:58:10,152 --> 00:58:11,502
Watson...
No. Like I said yesterday,

1167
00:58:11,504 --> 00:58:12,704
I'm only going along with this

1168
00:58:12,705 --> 00:58:14,505
if you let me monitor
your wound.

1169
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:16,874
Fine. Make your call from here,
we'll meet you at the car.

1170
00:58:16,876 --> 00:58:18,792
Thanks. Appreciate it.

1171
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:21,128
Oh, there's no
sign of infection,

1172
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,796
so that's good.

1173
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:24,181
Less talking, Watson,
more tending.

1174
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:25,999
Okay. What's the
pain like today?

1175
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:27,801
It's fine. It's barely
even noticeable.

1176
00:58:27,803 --> 00:58:30,020
Give me a number--
one to ten.

1177
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:31,522
Pi.

1178
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:32,856
It's a mathematical constant

1179
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:34,341
that is approximately
equal to...

1180
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,476
three point one four.
Three point one four, yes.

1181
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:38,529
If you're saying the
pain is about three,

1182
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:40,531
I don't believe you.
Hmm.

1183
00:58:40,533 --> 00:58:43,850
You said you need all of
your faculties to stop Moriarty.

1184
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:46,236
Seems like you're a few
short at the moment.

1185
00:58:49,524 --> 00:58:50,824
Hello?

1186
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:52,326
Hey, Joanie, it's me.

1187
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,877
Oh, hey, Oren.

1188
00:58:53,879 --> 00:58:55,963
Don't freak out,
but I've got some bad news.

1189
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,048
Mom slipped and fell
in some store this morning.

1190
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,499
Oh, my God.

1191
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:01,168
She's okay.
She just bumped her head.

1192
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,554
One of the ER doctors
used Mom's cell to call me.

1193
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:05,639
But I'm at a conference
in Barcelona this week.

1194
00:59:05,641 --> 00:59:07,707
I was hoping
you could go check on her.

1195
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:09,092
Of course.

1196
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:10,710
She's at Chandler Memorial.

1197
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:13,013
Okay, I will call you
once I get there.

1198
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:14,398
Okay, bye.

1199
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,216
You Watson women
and your heels.

1200
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:17,734
Your mother's
in her early 60s.

1201
00:59:17,736 --> 00:59:19,886
Should have resigned herself
to flats years ago.

1202
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:21,554
You heard all that?
Yup.

1203
00:59:21,556 --> 00:59:23,607
It's not like
I'm on any pain medication

1204
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:26,226
that might dull my senses.

1205
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:30,230
Look, if she's okay, I will meet
you in Westchester in an hour.

1206
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:33,533
I'll wait with baited breath.

1207
00:59:33,535 --> 00:59:35,135
Your mother is fine.

1208
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:37,120
I'm the one
who called your brother.

1209
00:59:37,122 --> 00:59:39,873
I apologize
for the subterfuge,

1210
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,675
but it seemed
the most expedient way

1211
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:43,410
to get you away from Sherlock.

1212
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:46,013
What do you want?

1213
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:50,767
Why... the pleasure
of your company, of course.

1214
00:59:56,742 --> 00:59:58,976
You're not afraid of me?

1215
00:59:58,978 --> 01:00:02,262
Too angry to be afraid.

1216
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:05,032
Maybe just because
we're in a crowded restaurant.

1217
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,566
Over the course of my career,

1218
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:08,101
I've plotted exactly
seven murders

1219
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:10,287
that were carried out
in crowded restaurants.

1220
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:12,656
Killing you here
is far from impossible.

1221
01:00:12,658 --> 01:00:14,574
It's just not what I want.

1222
01:00:14,576 --> 01:00:16,410
Why am I here?

1223
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,412
Because he took
an interest in you.

1224
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,163
I'd like to understand why.

1225
01:00:20,165 --> 01:00:21,782
'Cause you find him
so fascinating.

1226
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,301
What was the word
that you used the other night?

1227
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:26,003
Mm. Work of art.

1228
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:30,457
Far as I can determine,
you're a sort of... mascot.

1229
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,560
You were his sober companion,

1230
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:37,431
a professional angel to perch
on his shoulder, fend off

1231
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,965
his many demons, but now...

1232
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:41,468
now I don't know what you are.

1233
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,137
Do you want to sleep with him?

1234
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:48,492
I thought you told him
that you were just like him.

1235
01:00:50,411 --> 01:00:52,829
That you saw
the same things that he did.

1236
01:00:52,831 --> 01:00:55,198
Well, women can be a little bit
more difficult to read.

1237
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,649
Just ask Sherlock.

1238
01:00:58,704 --> 01:01:01,204
I asked him to allow me
to complete my business

1239
01:01:01,206 --> 01:01:02,706
in New York without interfering.

1240
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:05,342
He doesn't appear
to be complying.

1241
01:01:07,512 --> 01:01:10,013
Last night, you helped him
surveil a certain ship.

1242
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,466
This morning, he questioned
a certain businessman?

1243
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,017
How do you know about that?

1244
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:15,435
Surely by now you appreciate

1245
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:16,770
the scope of my organization.

1246
01:01:16,772 --> 01:01:18,221
I have eyes and ears

1247
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:19,973
in the most fascinating
of places.

1248
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:26,780
Hmm.

1249
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:32,869
Business.

1250
01:01:36,124 --> 01:01:40,127
Talk to Sherlock.

1251
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,862
Tell him I'll only be here
for a few more days.

1252
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:44,831
After that,
he can have his city back.

1253
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:48,201
He can have this whole
insipid country back.

1254
01:01:49,754 --> 01:01:53,173
You're afraid of him.

1255
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:56,927
If you weren't, you wouldn't
have gone to so much trouble.

1256
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:01,598
My dear Watson,

1257
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,652
I'm afraid of what
he might force me to do.

1258
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:12,492
I'm not sure
why my father-in-law

1259
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:14,194
told you what we do here,

1260
01:02:14,196 --> 01:02:16,997
but if you know, you know.

1261
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:21,201
This is a working
horse ranch.

1262
01:02:21,203 --> 01:02:24,037
We board,
we give lessons...

1263
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:25,439
There are also

1264
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:28,175
22 different
endangered species being

1265
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,909
cared for on the grounds.

1266
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:33,096
22 different kinds of
smuggled property, you mean?

1267
01:02:33,098 --> 01:02:34,464
We're not concerned about
your impromptu game reserve.

1268
01:02:34,466 --> 01:02:36,099
It's a lovely hobby.

1269
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:38,268
I would relish the chance
to spend an afternoon here.

1270
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,303
Unfortunately,
our business is pressing.

1271
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:42,755
My principal concern
is your wife.

1272
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:45,758
Well-well, why are you
concerned about Alethea?

1273
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,261
Quite an undertaking--
your Kenyan safari.

1274
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:51,448
Strange for one spouse
to leave the other behind.

1275
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,099
Don't you think?

1276
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:55,202
My wife's a
free spirit.

1277
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,770
Separate vacations have
always been part of the deal.

1278
01:02:57,772 --> 01:02:59,239
What are you doing?

1279
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:00,991
Far be it for me to, yeah,

1280
01:03:00,993 --> 01:03:02,826
speculate on the state
of your marriage,

1281
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:04,744
but I looked
in your coat closet,

1282
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:08,415
and I saw it was full of, uh,
top-of-the-line outerwear.

1283
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,383
His and hers.

1284
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:14,120
Gets quite brisk on the veldts
of Kenya, doesn't it?

1285
01:03:14,122 --> 01:03:16,756
So, any idea why
she left her gear behind?

1286
01:03:16,758 --> 01:03:18,558
Oh.

1287
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,312
You know, she probably...
got the latest thing.

1288
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:23,730
Hey!

1289
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:27,267
Yeah.

1290
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:30,320
Hey, this is a prescription
for Levothyroxine.

1291
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:33,273
That's a synthetic hormone
used to treat thyroiditis.

1292
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,909
This prescription was filled
by your wife nearly a month ago.

1293
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:38,478
Yet, there are only 18 pills
missing from this bottle.

1294
01:03:39,831 --> 01:03:41,481
She's failed

1295
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:46,036
to take her rather crucial
medication for almost a week.

1296
01:03:46,038 --> 01:03:48,588
Where's your wife, Mr. Lerberg?

1297
01:03:50,808 --> 01:03:53,960
A week ago, like you say.

1298
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:55,962
It was the middle
of the night.

1299
01:03:55,964 --> 01:03:59,516
Two guys in masks broke
into the house. They...

1300
01:03:59,518 --> 01:04:02,719
They took Alethea.

1301
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:09,676
My father-in-law gets
out here, he cuts me loose,

1302
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:12,445
he tells me the kidnappers have
already been in touch with him.

1303
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:14,614
He's supposed
to handle everything.

1304
01:04:14,616 --> 01:04:16,483
No cops, or she's dead.

1305
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,184
What can you tell us
about these two men?

1306
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:19,619
Not much.

1307
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,121
They were all covered up.

1308
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:24,023
Uh... one guy's sleeve rode up.

1309
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:27,694
I saw he had tattoos in, uh...

1310
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:30,413
What's that alphabet called?
Cyrillic.

1311
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,886
Sounds like it could be the
two guys we have in the morgue.

1312
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:38,255
I'll call the captain.

1313
01:04:57,825 --> 01:05:01,194
Watson... it's been
quite a productive errand.

1314
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:05,865
What?

1315
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:09,624
You should never
have gotten in that car, Watson.

1316
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,922
Excuse me, but the henchman
she was with had a gun.

1317
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:13,621
And you know what?
This is not my fault.

1318
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:14,625
I don't know
why you're blaming me.

1319
01:05:14,626 --> 01:05:16,126
You've fallen behind
on your self-defense studies.

1320
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:19,212
A gun which remains unpulled
cannot be brought to bear on a situation.

1321
01:05:19,214 --> 01:05:21,348
You weren't there, okay, so, you
have no idea what it was like...

1322
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,749
Uh, enough!
...when he came at me with the gun.

1323
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,250
Enough! You're both getting

1324
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:26,886
your own security details
until this all blows over,

1325
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:29,255
and I'm putting a couple of guys
at your residence, too.

1326
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:32,092
Now, Theophilus made bail
right after you left

1327
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,395
for Westchester,
but he's not at his apartment.

1328
01:05:35,397 --> 01:05:37,364
His lawyer
and his bail bondsman have

1329
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,566
no idea where he is.
The Narwhal has fled.

1330
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:42,068
If he'd wanted to tell us that
his daughter had been kidnapped,

1331
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,737
he had his chance to tell us
this morning.

1332
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:47,824
So Theophilus
isn't Moriarty's accomplice;

1333
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:50,210
he's her victim.

1334
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,629
I don't get it.

1335
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:55,248
All this just to snatch
some rich guy's daughter?

1336
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,116
There's more to it.
There has to be.

1337
01:05:57,118 --> 01:06:00,220
Moriarty has... flair.

1338
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,255
She pursues projects
which ignite her passions.

1339
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:05,392
It is very difficult to imagine
that her grand plan in America

1340
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:09,796
is something as prosaic
as a kidnapping for ransom.

1341
01:06:11,899 --> 01:06:14,017
Excuse me for a moment.

1342
01:06:17,805 --> 01:06:19,322
Hey, you okay?

1343
01:06:19,324 --> 01:06:21,274
Yeah, I'm fine. The pain
is quite intense at times,

1344
01:06:21,276 --> 01:06:22,742
but it's nothing
I can't handle.

1345
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:24,678
Spirit of the Dam-Busters
and all that.

1346
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,312
Hey.

1347
01:06:26,314 --> 01:06:28,698
So, I had our CCS guys
look for evidence

1348
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,084
of communication between
Theophilus and the kidnappers.

1349
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:33,319
Now, his computer
seemed clean at first

1350
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:35,488
but one of the techs figured out
that he'd just signed up

1351
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,040
for a new e-mail account
a week ago.

1352
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:39,325
Had him send me
a screen-cap of the inbox.

1353
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:41,795
Question mark.

1354
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,596
That was the caller I.D.
that came up

1355
01:06:43,598 --> 01:06:45,998
when Moriarty called Daniel
Gottlieb's phone to talk to us.

1356
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,551
Now, the e-mails were encrypted
with a public key code--

1357
01:06:48,553 --> 01:06:51,104
can't be broken-- but Theophilus
did download something

1358
01:06:51,106 --> 01:06:53,306
at the exact same time
one of 'em came in.

1359
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:56,226
It was on his hard drive.
That, we can get at.

1360
01:06:57,128 --> 01:06:58,344
You don't know who this is?

1361
01:06:58,346 --> 01:06:59,863
Why would Moriarty

1362
01:06:59,865 --> 01:07:03,015
send that picture to Theophilus?

1363
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,204
Mr. Theophilus.

1364
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:14,994
It's nice to finally meet
face-to-face.

1365
01:07:14,996 --> 01:07:18,298
You are the one who
took my daughter.

1366
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,701
Oh, I had some help.

1367
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,876
In all my years of smuggling,
I never handled one of these.

1368
01:07:29,878 --> 01:07:32,762
It's simple.
You just point and shoot.

1369
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:35,381
Repeatedly.

1370
01:07:43,524 --> 01:07:48,244
It's important in moments
like these to remember Alethea.

1371
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,868
I have your word

1372
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,937
that you will let her go when
I have done what you asked.

1373
01:07:57,939 --> 01:08:00,072
Of course.

1374
01:08:02,543 --> 01:08:05,745
Then you have my word.

1375
01:08:07,098 --> 01:08:11,351
This man and his family will
be dead by tomorrow night.

1376
01:08:22,944 --> 01:08:24,643
Sherlock!

1377
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:27,930
Sherlock!
 Morning.

1378
01:08:27,932 --> 01:08:30,265
You're slamming your hand
into your bullet wound.

1379
01:08:30,267 --> 01:08:32,118
I was having problems staying
awake and I tried reasoning

1380
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,569
with my hypothalamus, but...

1381
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:35,437
in the end,
it required corporal punishment.

1382
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,239
Well, there are police officers
standing outside. I'm surprised

1383
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:38,657
they didn't kick the door down.
Yes, they are waiting

1384
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:40,275
to take us
to a would-be murder victim.

1385
01:08:40,277 --> 01:08:42,628
Actually, it's been
a long night, Watson,

1386
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:46,132
but a productive one-- I believe
I have deduced Moriarty's plan.

1387
01:08:46,134 --> 01:08:47,333
You're kidding.

1388
01:08:49,553 --> 01:08:53,589
Right. This man
is named Andrej Bacera.

1389
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:55,725
His mother is presently

1390
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:57,793
the Speaker of Parliament
of the Republic

1391
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:00,262
of Macedonia.
She's a noted reformer,

1392
01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:02,098
popular figure.
Mr. Bacera himself,

1393
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,683
something of a favorite son
in his homeland.

1394
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:06,352
So why is Moriarty
interested

1395
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:08,320
in a couple
of Macedonian politicians?

1396
01:09:08,322 --> 01:09:10,156
Andrej Bacera is not
a politician.

1397
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:14,026
Not yet. He works as a vascular
surgeon here in New York.

1398
01:09:14,028 --> 01:09:17,780
Serves as an unofficial diplomat
when needed. Now...

1399
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:20,449
I refer you to a
map of the Balkan

1400
01:09:20,451 --> 01:09:21,500
Peninsula. This...

1401
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:23,536
is the Republic of Macedonia,

1402
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:24,820
a fledgling democracy
and applicant

1403
01:09:24,822 --> 01:09:25,788
for full membership

1404
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,256
to the European Union.

1405
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:29,175
Biggest obstacle
to its candidacy

1406
01:09:29,177 --> 01:09:31,660
is its ongoing dispute
with its neighbor--

1407
01:09:31,662 --> 01:09:32,845
Greece--

1408
01:09:32,847 --> 01:09:34,663
over the very name "Macedonia."

1409
01:09:34,665 --> 01:09:36,549
I thought Macedonia
was part of Greece.

1410
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:39,101
Macedonia is a
region in Greece,

1411
01:09:39,103 --> 01:09:40,436
birthplace
of Alexander the Great,

1412
01:09:40,438 --> 01:09:42,438
area of enormous
historical import,

1413
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,506
so you can imagine
Greece's chagrin

1414
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:47,777
when Yugoslavia broke apart
and one small new nation

1415
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:50,029
declared itself the
Republic of Macedonia.

1416
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:52,181
Two of my cousins both wanted
to name their sons Henry.

1417
01:09:52,183 --> 01:09:53,616
It was a big thing
at Thanksgiving.

1418
01:09:53,618 --> 01:09:54,784
What are you getting at?

1419
01:09:54,786 --> 01:09:57,236
Well, as long
as Macedonia insists

1420
01:09:57,238 --> 01:09:58,871
on calling itself Macedonia,

1421
01:09:58,873 --> 01:10:00,873
Greece has pledged to remain
intractably opposed

1422
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,825
to admitting them to the EU.

1423
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:05,878
However,
Andrej Bacera's mother...

1424
01:10:07,764 --> 01:10:10,583
...recently brokered
a compromise on the issue.

1425
01:10:10,585 --> 01:10:12,718
"In a few days, the current
Republic of Macedonia

1426
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,920
"is going to vote
on whether to join the EU

1427
01:10:14,922 --> 01:10:16,589
as the Republic
of New Macedonia."

1428
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:19,391
So they just added the word "New."
It worked.

1429
01:10:19,393 --> 01:10:21,560
Referendum is expected
to pass handily.

1430
01:10:21,562 --> 01:10:24,096
So, this is all very fascinating
in an NPR kind of way,

1431
01:10:24,098 --> 01:10:27,049
but I don't see how your nemesis
is gonna look at all this and...

1432
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:28,383
and see an opportunity.

1433
01:10:28,385 --> 01:10:29,985
Which is why you make
a much better companion

1434
01:10:29,987 --> 01:10:31,904
than you do a nemesis.

1435
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:34,190
It's all about currency.
This...

1436
01:10:34,192 --> 01:10:35,274
is a Macedonian denar.

1437
01:10:35,276 --> 01:10:37,359
You just had this lying around?

1438
01:10:37,361 --> 01:10:38,744
If the Macedonian
referendum passes,

1439
01:10:38,746 --> 01:10:40,579
the currency will switch
to the euro.

1440
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:42,397
The denar will become obsolete,
absolutely worthless.

1441
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:45,451
And yet not 48 hours ago,
a Swiss bank,

1442
01:10:45,453 --> 01:10:47,953
acting on behalf
of an enormous client,

1443
01:10:47,955 --> 01:10:50,572
purchased an enormous position
in the currency.

1444
01:10:50,574 --> 01:10:52,091
Why would anyone buy
into a currency

1445
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:53,792
that's about to become extinct?

1446
01:10:53,794 --> 01:10:56,512
They would not. Not unless they
planned to manipulate events

1447
01:10:56,514 --> 01:10:59,098
to prevent Macedonia
from joining the EU.

1448
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,582
Imagine the uproar...

1449
01:11:01,434 --> 01:11:03,302
...if a native of Greece,

1450
01:11:03,304 --> 01:11:05,271
someone known
to make contributions

1451
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:07,089
to nationalist causes

1452
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:10,926
murdered Macedonia's favorite
son on the eve of the vote.

1453
01:11:10,928 --> 01:11:12,561
Old passions
would be inflamed.

1454
01:11:12,563 --> 01:11:14,897
The vote to rename
the country would fail,

1455
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:18,150
and the denar would remain
the currency of Macedonia.

1456
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:20,102
Its value would soar.

1457
01:11:20,104 --> 01:11:22,538
So Moriarty kidnapped
the Narwhal's daughter

1458
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,874
to force him
to kill this man.

1459
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:27,793
All so she could make some
money on a currency bet.

1460
01:11:27,795 --> 01:11:29,611
Nearly a billion dollars.

1461
01:11:30,714 --> 01:11:33,716
What say we go stop this bitch?

1462
01:11:33,718 --> 01:11:35,885
Jordan?

1463
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,453
Jordan?

1464
01:11:38,455 --> 01:11:40,005
Where's Jordan?

1465
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:41,473
Andrej, what's wrong?

1466
01:11:41,475 --> 01:11:44,293
Jordan, there's a New York
police captain

1467
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:46,512
on the phone-- he says
there's a man coming to kill me.

1468
01:11:48,815 --> 01:11:50,983
This is Jordan Conroy.

1469
01:11:50,985 --> 01:11:52,634
I handle security
for the Baceras.

1470
01:11:52,636 --> 01:11:55,070
Mr. Conroy, this is
Captain Gregson with the NYPD.

1471
01:11:55,072 --> 01:11:56,972
Is it just you there
or do you have a team?

1472
01:11:56,974 --> 01:11:58,357
It's just me. Why?

1473
01:11:58,359 --> 01:11:59,825
We have reason to believe

1474
01:11:59,827 --> 01:12:01,393
Mr. Bacera's being targeted

1475
01:12:01,395 --> 01:12:05,447
by a Greek national by the name
of Christos Theophilus.

1476
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:07,833
We're actually on our way
to you right now.

1477
01:12:07,835 --> 01:12:09,335
Can you give me a description?

1478
01:12:09,337 --> 01:12:11,086
He's a white male, six feet,

1479
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:13,005
about 190. I texted a photograph

1480
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:15,291
to Mr. Bacera.

1481
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:16,992
We've got a safe room here.
Top of the line.

1482
01:12:16,994 --> 01:12:20,162
I'll get Mr. and Mrs. Bacera
inside it right away.

1483
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:37,863
We need to do
this quickly.

1484
01:12:43,236 --> 01:12:45,454
Step outside.

1485
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,074
Uh...

1486
01:12:49,076 --> 01:12:50,993
wh-what you really want,

1487
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:54,747
you can have it. Please...
Now.

1488
01:13:04,057 --> 01:13:05,808
Jordan?

1489
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:12,481
What's going on here?

1490
01:13:12,483 --> 01:13:16,018
What have you done?
Jordan, please...

1491
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,604
please help us.

1492
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:33,335
911, what's your emergency?

1493
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:35,954
My name is Christos Theophilus.

1494
01:13:35,956 --> 01:13:37,956
I'm in the house of the snake,

1495
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:41,593
Andrej Bacera.

1496
01:13:41,595 --> 01:13:42,961
What I do now...

1497
01:13:42,963 --> 01:13:45,597
I do for the love
of my country.

1498
01:13:45,599 --> 01:13:47,683
Please...

1499
01:13:47,685 --> 01:13:48,967
Please, I'm-I'm begging you...

1500
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:11,940
Poppa? It's me. I'm okay.

1501
01:14:11,942 --> 01:14:14,209
Poppa? Are you there?

1502
01:14:14,211 --> 01:14:17,463
They just left me in front
of the farm and drove away.

1503
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:18,947
I'm with Chad now.

1504
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:21,467
The police are on their way.

1505
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:24,086
Are you there?

1506
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:28,841
Do it now. Please.

1507
01:14:31,594 --> 01:14:33,495
Right after I hung up,

1508
01:14:33,497 --> 01:14:35,864
I was struck from behind.

1509
01:14:35,866 --> 01:14:38,567
Next thing I know I'm zip tied
to the banister

1510
01:14:38,569 --> 01:14:41,520
and he's taking Andrej
and Jovana into the bedroom.

1511
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:43,322
I managed to get free,

1512
01:14:43,324 --> 01:14:46,992
but then... I heard
the first two shots.

1513
01:14:46,994 --> 01:14:48,610
I had a gun

1514
01:14:48,612 --> 01:14:50,645
in my ankle holster
that he hadn't spotted.

1515
01:14:50,647 --> 01:14:52,281
I grabbed it.

1516
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:55,000
I made my way into the room.

1517
01:14:55,002 --> 01:14:56,752
I fired...

1518
01:14:56,754 --> 01:14:58,954
but not before he'd shot
Mrs. Bacera.

1519
01:14:58,956 --> 01:15:00,956
Captain, don't listen to a word
this man says.

1520
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,868
Holmes, I thought you
were still at the scene.

1521
01:15:02,893 --> 01:15:03,877
Mr. Conroy,

1522
01:15:03,878 --> 01:15:05,177
how long have you been
working with Moriarty

1523
01:15:05,179 --> 01:15:06,428
and how long
has she been planning this?

1524
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,597
Hey. Hey.

1525
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:10,516
Do you want to tell me
what's going on here?

1526
01:15:10,518 --> 01:15:14,169
Yeah. I had a chance to peruse
Mr. Conroy's curriculum vitae

1527
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:16,522
while I was
at the Bacera residence.

1528
01:15:16,524 --> 01:15:18,023
Currently under the employ

1529
01:15:18,025 --> 01:15:20,192
of a company called Lexicon
Personal Security, yes?

1530
01:15:20,194 --> 01:15:22,361
Would you like to know
what that company was called

1531
01:15:22,363 --> 01:15:23,979
until just a week ago?

1532
01:15:23,981 --> 01:15:25,680
Sutter Risk Management.

1533
01:15:25,682 --> 01:15:27,866
We think it's one of Moriarty's
shell corporations.

1534
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:29,851
Am I supposed to know that name?
She used me

1535
01:15:29,853 --> 01:15:31,353
to prove that the Sutters
had committed a murder,

1536
01:15:31,355 --> 01:15:32,871
most likely to clear
the decks for you.

1537
01:15:32,873 --> 01:15:35,357
You were not assigned
to Mr. and Mrs. Bacera

1538
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,359
a few weeks ago, were you?
You joined their detail

1539
01:15:37,361 --> 01:15:41,046
just recently, a move no doubt
orchestrated by your new owner.

1540
01:15:41,048 --> 01:15:43,549
I would've given my life
for the Baceras.

1541
01:15:43,551 --> 01:15:45,334
You let a murderer
into their home,

1542
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:47,869
and then you murdered him
to cover it up.

1543
01:15:50,007 --> 01:15:51,423
Sherlock!
Get off him!

1544
01:15:51,425 --> 01:15:55,010
No!
Get... get him out of here.

1545
01:15:55,012 --> 01:15:57,429
Ow!

1546
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:01,049
You're bleeding again.

1547
01:16:01,051 --> 01:16:02,818
You must've popped your stitches.
I'm fine.

1548
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:04,553
Sherlock...
I said I'm fine!

1549
01:16:04,555 --> 01:16:06,271
Hey! You need
to get a hold of yourself!

1550
01:16:09,059 --> 01:16:11,743
I had her. I had her. I...

1551
01:16:11,745 --> 01:16:12,727
uncovered her plan,

1552
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:13,946
saw how to stop her

1553
01:16:13,948 --> 01:16:15,781
and she succeeded.

1554
01:16:15,783 --> 01:16:17,907
Three people died today
because of me.

1555
01:16:17,932 --> 01:16:18,751
Are you listening to me?

1556
01:16:18,752 --> 01:16:21,453
Captain Gregson wanted to pull
your credentials a few days ago.

1557
01:16:21,455 --> 01:16:22,871
I convinced him not to.

1558
01:16:22,873 --> 01:16:24,756
Yes, because you know
that a good detective

1559
01:16:24,758 --> 01:16:27,125
doesn't just stop because things
get inconvenient!

1560
01:16:28,211 --> 01:16:30,762
Sherlock...

1561
01:16:30,764 --> 01:16:32,080
I think it's time.

1562
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:33,715
For what?!

1563
01:16:33,717 --> 01:16:35,417
You-you know
I'll investigate this anyway,

1564
01:16:35,419 --> 01:16:37,386
whether I have Captain Gregson's
blessing or not.

1565
01:16:37,388 --> 01:16:39,605
That is your choice,
but right now, we are

1566
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:41,089
enabling you.

1567
01:16:41,091 --> 01:16:43,775
If you are the partner
that I invited you to be,

1568
01:16:43,777 --> 01:16:46,261
the partner that I believe
that you can be,

1569
01:16:46,263 --> 01:16:48,564
then you will stop this line
of thought immediately!

1570
01:16:48,566 --> 01:16:49,931
I am your partner,

1571
01:16:49,933 --> 01:16:51,433
and you cannot keep
going on like this!

1572
01:16:51,435 --> 01:16:53,068
Now, what...?
You know, I almost stole

1573
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,987
a vial of opiates
from a crime scene yesterday.

1574
01:16:58,274 --> 01:17:00,659
You know why I didn't?
Because of you.

1575
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:04,279
Because I knew how disappointed
that you would be in me.

1576
01:17:04,281 --> 01:17:08,333
And if I only had the words to
describe how disappointed in you

1577
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:11,637
I am at the moment...

1578
01:17:16,626 --> 01:17:19,177
I don't expect you
to understand right now,

1579
01:17:19,179 --> 01:17:22,314
but I know what you need to do.

1580
01:17:23,483 --> 01:17:26,435
Moriarty said she
was smarter than you,

1581
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:28,303
that you needed
to let her win.

1582
01:17:28,305 --> 01:17:31,473
It is the only way this
does not eat you alive.

1583
01:17:32,609 --> 01:17:35,027
She was right.

1584
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,497
Let her win.

1585
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:43,252
Yeah, yeah, I'll let you know
if he shows up.

1586
01:17:43,254 --> 01:17:45,820
Um, give me a minute.

1587
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,258
Hey.

1588
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,176
Aren't you meant to
be waiting outside?

1589
01:17:51,178 --> 01:17:52,544
I just talked
to the sergeant

1590
01:17:52,546 --> 01:17:54,212
in charge
of your protective detail.

1591
01:17:54,214 --> 01:17:56,765
He told me you ditched him
outside the precinct.

1592
01:17:56,767 --> 01:17:58,166
What's the deal?

1593
01:17:58,168 --> 01:17:59,551
You okay?

1594
01:17:59,553 --> 01:18:01,219
Going upstairs to shower.

1595
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:04,022
Surely your jurisdiction
ends there.

1596
01:18:36,038 --> 01:18:38,140
What's up, Captain?

1597
01:18:38,142 --> 01:18:40,875
Holmes stormed out
of the station a while back.

1598
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:42,260
Is he there?

1599
01:18:42,262 --> 01:18:44,062
Yeah, he just got in.

1600
01:18:44,064 --> 01:18:45,764
What about Watson?
Is she with him?

1601
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:48,233
No. What's going on?

1602
01:18:48,235 --> 01:18:50,124
A corner drug dealer in Bushwick

1603
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:53,493
got beaten and robbed
about a half hour ago.

1604
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,695
Witnesses said
the perp was British,

1605
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:57,964
and his arm was in a sling.

1606
01:19:00,551 --> 01:19:02,719
Holmes?

1607
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:04,220
Let me in.

1608
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,707
Come on, open up!

1609
01:19:13,636 --> 01:19:17,071
Holmes? Can you hear me?

1610
01:19:17,073 --> 01:19:19,156
Hmm? Hey, get an ambulance now.

1611
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:20,741
He just OD'd.

1612
01:19:20,776 --> 01:19:23,528
Stay with me. Hey. Hey. Holmes.

1613
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:37,859
I know you're awake.

1614
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:40,829
I appreciate you're
cross with me, but...

1615
01:19:40,831 --> 01:19:43,465
please don't tell
me I've managed

1616
01:19:43,467 --> 01:19:45,801
to make the great
Sherlock Holmes shy.

1617
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:53,258
There's a guard at my door.

1618
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,094
I haven't hurt him,
just distracted him.

1619
01:19:56,096 --> 01:19:58,547
Ah.

1620
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:00,415
I warned you.

1621
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:03,351
I practically begged you.

1622
01:20:05,254 --> 01:20:07,772
Why didn't you listen?

1623
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:12,760
You asked me to let you win.

1624
01:20:14,096 --> 01:20:16,748
I'd say that I have really.

1625
01:20:18,484 --> 01:20:22,604
You compelled
Christos Theophilus to murder

1626
01:20:22,606 --> 01:20:25,290
two innocent people
this morning.

1627
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:28,710
And then you made a fortune
in the resulting chaos.

1628
01:20:28,712 --> 01:20:32,297
I did,
but I didn't want... this.

1629
01:20:32,299 --> 01:20:34,466
Not again.

1630
01:20:34,468 --> 01:20:37,135
Yeah.

1631
01:20:37,137 --> 01:20:39,054
Why did you come here?

1632
01:20:42,592 --> 01:20:44,976
I want to help you.

1633
01:20:44,978 --> 01:20:47,812
You-you adopted
a fake persona,

1634
01:20:47,814 --> 01:20:50,232
you seduced me,

1635
01:20:50,234 --> 01:20:52,651
faked your own death...

1636
01:20:52,653 --> 01:20:55,303
so, forgive me

1637
01:20:55,305 --> 01:20:59,140
if I, uh... if I don't want
any more of your help.

1638
01:20:59,142 --> 01:21:00,909
Would you have preferred
I'd just killed you?

1639
01:21:02,995 --> 01:21:05,647
Yes.

1640
01:21:09,585 --> 01:21:13,371
I knew that my death
would be quite a blow.

1641
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:16,174
I knew it would keep
you occupied while I...

1642
01:21:16,176 --> 01:21:18,793
carried on with other projects,

1643
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:21,829
but I...

1644
01:21:21,831 --> 01:21:26,718
I failed to predict your
descent into addiction.

1645
01:21:28,504 --> 01:21:30,805
Well, you surprised me.

1646
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:34,192
You're the only person
on the planet who can.

1647
01:21:34,194 --> 01:21:36,895
That's why you love me,
though, isn't it?

1648
01:21:38,013 --> 01:21:40,315
Is that why
you came here?

1649
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:42,567
To tell me?

1650
01:21:46,689 --> 01:21:49,541
Do you know why
you're so drawn to narcotics?

1651
01:21:49,543 --> 01:21:52,911
Because you're in near
constant pain.

1652
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:56,331
Your sensitivities-- they
make you a great detective,

1653
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,667
but they also hurt you.

1654
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:02,387
I know what that's like,
Sherlock.

1655
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:04,923
Only me.

1656
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:08,677
I'm leaving the country tonight.

1657
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:11,096
I want you to come with me.

1658
01:22:13,649 --> 01:22:16,551
You're broken
to pieces right now.

1659
01:22:16,553 --> 01:22:19,738
I can put you back together.

1660
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:24,559
And once you're whole, I'll show
you a different way to live.

1661
01:22:24,561 --> 01:22:29,080
We are... the same.

1662
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:31,950
You and I.

1663
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:35,903
We both made the same mistake.

1664
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:40,842
We fell in love.

1665
01:22:43,112 --> 01:22:44,846
It made us stupid.

1666
01:22:44,848 --> 01:22:46,631
I made nearly
a billion dollars today.

1667
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:48,099
I don't feel stupid.

1668
01:22:49,436 --> 01:22:52,920
Yeah.

1669
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:56,775
You know...

1670
01:22:56,777 --> 01:22:59,277
she solved you.

1671
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:01,980
The mascot.

1672
01:23:03,733 --> 01:23:06,368
Watson.

1673
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:07,952
She diagnosed your...

1674
01:23:07,954 --> 01:23:12,040
condition earlier this evening.

1675
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:18,713
She realized the real reason
you could never...

1676
01:23:18,715 --> 01:23:22,634
quite bring yourself to kill me.

1677
01:23:22,636 --> 01:23:25,170
The reason
you came back to my life.

1678
01:23:27,256 --> 01:23:31,259
Ah... the reason
you came here.

1679
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:35,347
That's why she encouraged me
to let you win.

1680
01:23:39,068 --> 01:23:41,969
Well, at least make it...

1681

yeah... make-make it look
like you'd won.

1682
01:23:49,311 --> 01:23:51,279
You faked the overdose.

01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:54,982
Yeah. Uh...

1684
