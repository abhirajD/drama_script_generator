1
00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:05,375
MAN: I have been sober for two years,
seven months, and 13 days now.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,562
I could... give you
how many hours in seconds,

3
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:12,294
but then you might think
I'm obsessive. (chuckles)

4
00:00:12,296 --> 00:00:14,425
I guess I just want to say...

5
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:15,958
thank you.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,558
Uh, without these meetings,

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,324
without the support
of people like you,

8
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:22,122
I just don't know where I'd be.

9
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:24,557
(people clapping)

10
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:29,291
MODERATOR:
Thanks, Eric.

11
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:30,993
Hey.

12
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,695
You okay?

13
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:34,631
MODERATOR: All right, we're gonna
wrap things up now.

14
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,965
Uh, tomorrow's meeting...

15
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,299
Sherlock...
Amygdala!

16
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,600
(clears throat)

17
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:41,234
(smacks lips)

18
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:43,968
Mm, 6:00.

19
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,604
Excellent.

20
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,241
WATSON:
<i>What do you mean</i>

21
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,744
you put yourself in a trance?
Hypnotize myself.

22
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:53,879
Simple, really.

23
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,414
The key is
word repetition.

24
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,482
My word, as you
may have guessed,

25
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:59,083
is "amygdala."

26
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:00,551
So you hypnotized yourself

27
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,452
at your first group
support meeting?

28
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:05,154
Couldn't listen to all those
sob stories, now, could I?

29
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:06,756
That's the whole point.

30
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,058
And, you know, when you feel
comfortable, you can share.

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,126
You've lived with me
a week now, Watson.

32
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:12,595
You know I don't share.

33
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:14,330
Well, then why
can't you listen?

34
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,065
Attic Theory.

35
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:19,134
I've always believed the human
brain is like... an attic.

36
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,137
A storage space for facts.

37
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,305
But because that
space is finite,

38
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:25,007
it must be filled
only with the things

39
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,310
one needs to be the
best version of oneself.

40
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:29,446
It's important, therefore,
not to have useless facts.

41
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,948
The natterings that comprise
a typical support group meeting,

44
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,220
Just...

45
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,788
Can I borrow this?

46
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,856
WOMAN: Hey, what are you doing?
He's nuts.

47
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:42,025
Your brain, hm?

48
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,794
Useful facts.

49
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,965
Useful, viscous, golden.

50
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,501
Natterings.

51
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,912
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

52
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,413
That is not even how
the brain works...

53
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,848
It's how <i>my</i> brain works.

54
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,216
Okay, more natterings:

55
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:09,351
I am going to a dinner
tonight with a friend,

56
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,353
but I will be back
before 10:00,

57
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:12,921
so I'll be there
at 8:00...

58
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,823
Two whole hours
by my lonesome?

59
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,825
Aren't you worried I'll go
on some sort of binge?

60
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,826
Well, brief
stretches apart

61
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:19,535
are actually a natur...

62
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,397
A natural progression
in our companionship.

63
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:22,797
Yes, you mentioned.

64
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,232
But just to be safe,

65
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:27,001
I will be giving you a drug test
when I get home.

66
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:30,238
(phone rings)

67
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,274
Captain Gregson...

68
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:35,877
How may I be of assistance?

69
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,279
GREGSON:
Name's Casey McManus.

70
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,414
Walked through his front door
tonight

71
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,149
and took one right
between the eyes.

72
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,851
Cousin's on the job.

73
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:45,219
Patrolman assigned
to the 116 in Queens.

74
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,988
That's why
I called you.

75
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,589
Gotta have
my best guys on this.

76
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:52,593
You said on the phone
he walked in on a burglar.

77
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:55,029
MAN: He did.
His watch and wallet are gone.

78
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:56,464
The drawers were tossed, too.

79
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,331
The victim probably startled
the perp

80
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,433
when he came in from the hall.

81
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,501
Holmes, Ms. Watson,
meet Detective Bell--

82
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,536
another one
of my best guys.

83
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:04,572
Hi.
He's running point on the case.

84
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:06,774
You're the
consultant, right?

85
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,242
I heard good things.

86
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:12,046
Yeah, of course you did.
Who's he?

87
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,281
Neighbor from across the hall.

88
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:17,450
He's the one who saw the body
through the door and called 911.

89
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:18,651
Captain.

90
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:20,186
I'm gonna wait
in the hall.

91
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:21,821
Why must you
continue to act

92
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:23,622
like you've never seen
a dead body before?

93
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:25,290
You were a surgeon.
You went to medical school.

94
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,558
Surely, you worked on cadavers.

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,262
Right. Because that's
exactly the same thing.

96
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,782
(sniffing)

97
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,189
Detective Bell!

98
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:01,827
You would classify this as a
robbery-homicide, would you not?

99
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,228
Yeah.

100
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,430
You would be wrong.

101
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:06,332
This was a robbery
& a homicide.

102
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:07,600
Ampersand, not dash.

103
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:09,568
There were two separate
crimes committed

104
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,170
by two separate perpetrators.

105
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:12,705
The trajectory of the bullet

106
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:15,575
that killed Mr. McManus
traces back to this chair.

107
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:17,844
The killer was seated
when she pulled the trigger.

108
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,513
She?

109
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,182
I can smell "T-Blossom" brand
deodorant on the leather.

110
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:24,251
It's lady's deodorant.

111
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,286
A woman sat here
quite recently.

112
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,188
None of your people,
of course.

113
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,790
This is an active
crime scene,

114
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,492
and knowing you, Captain,
they know better.

115
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:33,060
That leaves the shooter.

116
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,797
Go on.

117
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:40,668
The second crime, the robbery,
was committed by a man.

118
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,771
A very strong man judging by

119
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:45,207
the items he removed
from the apartment.

120
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,275
How strong does
a guy have to be

121
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:49,044
to steal a wallet
and a watch?

122
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:51,079
You're forgetting
the armoire.

123
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,381
Dust patterns on the wall
and the floor

124
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:55,116
tell us it stood here,

125
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:58,153
as do these scratches
on the floor.

126
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:59,922
You're nuts.

127
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,690
Actually, he's not.

128
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,830
It was a very heavy piece
of furniture, that.

129
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,331
And this building
has no elevator.

130
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,999
Are we to suppose
that the thief got it down

131
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,068
six flights of stairs
before the police arrived?

132
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,203
Of course not.

133
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:17,506
Yet the scratches on the floor
tell us

134
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:21,476
it was dragged into
the tiled hallway.

135
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,345
Makes me think
it never left this floor.

136
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:24,746
What do you think?

137
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:30,118
Yeah, thought so.
Across the hall you said?

138
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,354
You, you can't go in there.
You need a warrant.

139
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:36,691
Bureaucracy. One of the many
reasons I'm not a policeman.

140
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:37,893
GREGSON:
Holmes, halt.

141
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:43,632
Thief.

142
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,235
Now all you need is your killer.

Casey was already dead
when I found him.

147
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,471
I know I should've called
the cops first,

148

You know, I just...
Freakin' economy, I...

And that armoire
was an antique.

It's worth two grand
at least.

But I, I never laid
a finger on him.

No, you didn't.

You put a bullet
in his brain.

155

Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong!

156
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:54,725
What's wrong?

157
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:55,993
I'm sorry,
I don't think

158

I could've been much
clearer earlier.

159
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:59,063
There were two crimes,
two perpetrators.

160
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:01,631
This guy had all
of the victim's stuff.

161
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,866
But no gun.
Not anywhere in his apartment.

162
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:06,402
I suspect the GSR test
your people performed

163
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:08,404
will show that he hasn't fired
one of late.

00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:10,272
Also, he isn't wearing
any deodorant,

165
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:12,274
let alone Lady's "T-Blossom."
Or hadn't you noticed?

166
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:14,776
You're the only one who could
smell anything on that chair.

167
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:16,944
The chair, right--
I'm glad you brought that up.

168
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:19,913
If, per Detective Bell's theory,
the burglar was startled

169
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:22,048
by the victim's unexpected
return, why was he sitting down?

170
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,216
It's a curious time
to take a load off, no?

171
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,185
You know what, Sherlock?

172
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,720
Hey, do you mind getting me
a bag of chips?

173
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,722
I think there's a vending
machine around the corner.

174
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:35,992
(door shuts)

175
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:37,827
He wasn't asked
to consult here

176
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,962
because of his charming
personality.

177
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,098
Was he always like this?

178
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,167
I mean, back when you knew him
in Scotland Yard?

179
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,668
He was a pain in the ass.

180
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,039
But he was also
very, very good.

181
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,107
He said when he
introduced you last week

182
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:56,177
that you were
his, um, "personal valet"?

183
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:59,913
That's sort of like
a butler, right?

184
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:01,247
You must've been
really happy

185
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:02,848
when he relocated here
in New York.

186
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,350
Actually, he reached out to me

187
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,585
before he left London
two weeks ago.

188
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,054
He called you
from London?

189
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:15,459
Yeah. Said he was calling
from Heathrow. Why?

190
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,094
Excuse me.

191
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,502
Neighbor just won't cop
to the shooting.

192
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,104
Says he wants
a lawyer.

193
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,305
Smart man.

194
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,172
He didn't kill anyone.
He should get a lawyer.

195
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,575
He's also saying that
he passed a "strange woman"

196
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:35,744
on the stairwell right before
he found the victim's body.

197
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,512
Excellent! Did he get
a good look at her?

198
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:39,413
Yeah, he can describe
her to a T.

199
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:42,015
Probably because she's a product
of his freakin' imagination.

200
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:44,117
Obviously, he heard
Harry Potter here

201
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:47,486
say something about a female
shooter back at the scene,

202
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:49,254
and now he's trying to serve us
one on a platter.

203
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:51,190
You need to sit him
with a sketch artist.

204
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:52,992
Circulate an image
of this woman ASAP.

205
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:54,226
I'm sorry. I got to ask who's
running this investigation?

206
00:08:54,228 --> 00:08:55,861
You indicated this case was important
to the morale of your men.

207
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:57,096
I think this guy's gonna have us
chasing some fictional shooter.

208
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:58,097
You really want to run the risk

209
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:59,466
of pinning the murder
on the wrong person?

210
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:01,334
Call down to headquarters
and get me a sketch artist.

211
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,570
But, Captain...
If he's wrong,

212
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:07,106
he's wrong, but I want
to know he's wrong.

213
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,453
HOLMES:
That was impressive earlier,

214
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,421
noticing the photograph of the
armoire at the victim's house.

215
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,056
I didn't need it
to prove my point,

216
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,124
of course, but it helped.

217
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,459
You're welcome.

218
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,827
Um, I've got to go
meet my friend soon.

219
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:28,663
You're going to be okay
getting home by yourself?

220
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,034
This, uh, friend
that you're meeting--

221
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:36,270
when was the last time
you slept with him?

222
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,005
It's quite obvious
it's a he and an ex-lover.

223
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:39,774
You go out of your way
to avoid gender

224
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:41,276
every time
you talk about him

225
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,845
and you avert your gaze
every time you say "friend."

226
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:45,814
As to how I know
it's not a current lover,

227
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,249
your walk speaks
volumes.

228
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,383
My walk?

229
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:49,751
Study in Belgium showed

230
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:51,219
that a woman's
recent orgasmic history

231
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,355
can be discerned
from her gait.

232
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:55,658
Yours would indicate
it's been a while.

233
00:09:57,494 --> 00:10:00,397
Is it sad being wrong
as often as you are right?

234
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,498
My advice:
sleep with him.

235
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,066
Do wonders
for your mood.

236
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:06,036
(sighs)

237
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,943
Ty, hey, sorry I'm late.
Oh, please.

238
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,812
I'm the one who should
be apologizing.

239
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,580
I'm the one who had
to reschedule twice.

240
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,581
That's true.

241
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,982
DA's keeping you busy?

242
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,951
Ah, if I don't keep
winning cases for him,

243
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,520
how will I ever
take his job?

244
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,789
(laughs)
Uh, how about you?

245
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,459
You, uh, just started
with a client last week, right?

246
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,426
How's it going?

247
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,496
Good, fine, great.

248
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,564
So, what is
she-- a, uh,

249
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,766
alcoholic, addict, both?

250
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,369
You know I don't talk
about my clients, right?

251
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:38,804
Oh, sorry.

252
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,906
Uh, I know we're not
together anymore,

253
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,207
but I still worry about you.

254
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,442
I'm fine.

255
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:48,047
The thing is, I'm not
the only one who's worried.

256
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:51,929
Oh, my God, my parents-- tell me
they didn't reach out to you.

257
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,187
They said you're not
returning their calls.

258
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:54,654
Yeah, well,
I don't need a lecture

259
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,289
every time I speak
to them, so I...

260
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,957
They're confused, Joan.

261
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,826
You used to be a surgeon.
Now you babysit drug addicts.

262
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:03,062
I know how much it hurt
when you lost that patient,

263
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:05,632
but if you're doing all this
as some kind of penance...

264
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:08,801
I am doing this because
I'm actually good at it.

265
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,140
I don't know why that's
so hard to understand.

266
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:25,654
Hey, I made coffee.

267
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:28,324
Thank you.

268
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:33,362
It'll be right here
when you're ready.

269
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:42,671
Didn't take my advice, I see.

270
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:45,006
Didn't sleep
with your ex.

271
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:47,976
What are you working on?

272
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:49,544
Casey McManus' preliminary
autopsy report

273
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,012
came in a little
while ago.

274
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,747
Just going through some
of the particulars.

275
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,081
I thought there was
only one particular--

276
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,384
the, uh, gunshot wound
to the head.

277
00:11:56,386 --> 00:12:00,755
Victim also suffered from
endothelial corneal dystrophy.

278
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:02,857
Oh, that's a gray clouding
of the cornea.

279
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,793
That's a genetic disorder.

280
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:06,428
But how is that relevant?

281
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,863
How is it not?

282
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:13,869
Um, can we talk
about Captain Gregson?

283
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:17,040
He's married, I'm afraid,
quite happily.

284
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,274
(sniffs)

285
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:19,376
You're funny.

286
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:20,910
I was talking to him
the other night,

287
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:23,513
and I wanted to know
why you didn't tell him

288
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,282
where you were
the last six months.

289
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,684
He said you called him
from Heathrow ten days ago

290
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:28,852
when I know for a fact

291
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:30,653
that you were in rehab
still in New York.

292
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:32,622
You're a highly decorated
New York City Police captain.

293
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:34,324
Would you allow a
recovering drug addict

294
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:35,925
access to sensitive cases?
I'm not saying that...

295
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,760
I can help him, but
only if he lets me.

296
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:39,228
Okay, you're not under...
Telling him would be

297
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,964
a violation of our
client-companion privilege.

298
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:42,232
I could sue.

299
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:46,269
I am not going to tell him
anything, obviously.

300
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:49,006
I just think it's sad
that you can't be honest

301
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:50,541
with a man who,
as far as I can tell,

302
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:51,909
is the closest thing
you have to a friend.

303
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,912
(phone ringing)
That's all.

304
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,347
Sherlock Holmes.

305
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:57,981
Yeah, it's Bell.

306
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,616
The captain gave me
your number.

307
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:01,552
Look, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

308
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:03,320
but I found the woman
from the sketch

309
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,322
that was generated
last night.

310
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:08,024
The one the neighbor saw leaving
Casey McManus' apartment?

311
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:09,692
Yeah, look, how fast can you get

312
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:13,263
to St. Isidora Hospital
on East 93rd?

313
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:15,866
(siren chirps)

314
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:17,634
I assume you already
got one of these?

315
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:20,604
Yeah, dark hair, mid-30s,
approximately 5'4".

316
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:21,939
Captain Gregson e-mailed me.

317
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:23,507
Where is she?
I'm getting to that.

318
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,309
First I'm gonna tell
you how I got here.

319
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:27,646
I was about to put the
sketch out wide last night

320
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,047
when one of my old
uni buddies said

321
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,382
Sketch Girl
looked familiar.

322
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,549
Well, he gave me a name,

323
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:33,418
and the name got me
to a photograph.

324
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,753
Yvette Ellison--
dark hair,

325
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,954
mid-30s.

326
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:40,523
I slipped her picture into a
photo array for the neighbor,

327
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:42,091
and he picked it out...
right away.

328
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:45,128
He said, and I quote,
"There was no doubt about it."

329
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,864
This was the girl he saw
on the stairs last night.

330
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,166
Are you going to make me guess
where she is, Detective,

331
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:51,534
or are you going
to show me?

332
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:54,337
I'm gonna show you.

333
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,708
Mr. Holmes, Ms. Watson,
meet Yvette Ellison.

334
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,544
She tried to kill herself
three days ago.

335
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:04,313
Chased a vial of sleeping pills
with a bottle of vodka.

336
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:06,649
My buddy was on the scene when
the paramedics took her away,

337
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,317
which is why
he recognized her.

338
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,586
She's been in a coma ever since.

339
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,121
Three days ago?

340
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:13,756
Yeah, the neighbor lied.

341
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:15,758
Made up a description
and then ID'd

342
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,960
one of the only people
in the city we know

343
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,262
couldn't have killed
Casey McManus last night,

344
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:24,333
so thanks
for the, uh, consultation,

345
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,534
but I think I'll take it

346
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,703
from here.

347
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,879
WATSON: So Detective Bell
was right.

348
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,946
Is it such
a big...?

349
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:40,882
Shh.

350
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:41,849
Yvette!

351
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:43,851
What is wrong
with you?

352
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:46,321
Closed eyes do not
necessarily a coma make.

353
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:47,389
You think
she's faking?

354
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,258
(sniffs)

355
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,259
It's T-Blossom deodorant--

356
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,095
the same
as in the crime scene.

357
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:55,065
What are you doing?

358
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,099
Looking for a syringe.

359
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:57,100
What for?

360
00:14:57,102 --> 00:14:58,701
I'm going to stab it

361
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:00,937
into the softest part
of Ms. Ellison's thigh.

362
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:02,305
Lots of nerve endings there--

363
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:03,739
no one can fake their way
through that.

364
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,808
If you wanted to know

365
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,276
if she was really in a coma,

366
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,512
all you had to do was ask.

367
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:16,319
That's okay, but I can't
stab her in the thigh?

368
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:17,654
It's a test for pseudocoma.

369
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:18,655
When the patient's
hand is released

370
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:19,956
directly above the face,

371
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,392
it should strike the
face on the way down.

372
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:24,427
Easy to fake.

373
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,896
Yeah, well,

374
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:28,498
respiration and pupillary
response aren't,

375
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,767
and hers are consistent with
a patient in a comatose state.

376
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:33,703
Her coma is real.

377
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,371
She didn't kill
that man last night.

378
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:36,372
(door opens)

379
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:38,474
Can I help you?

380
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:39,976
Your patient?

381
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:41,744
She is.

382
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:45,215
Her coma is quite real.

383
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:54,624
WATSON:
That was a dead end.

384
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,193
Actually it wasn't.

385
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:59,830
Detective Bell found the right
face, but the wrong girl.

386
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:02,065
There was a book on
Yvette's nightstand.

387
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,467
Obviously someone's
been reading it to her.

388
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,669
The inscription on
the inside cover said,

389
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:08,772
<i>"To Yvette and Rebecca</i>
<i>on your fifth birthday."</i>

390
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:11,574
"Your fifth birthday," as in
the birthday you both share.

391
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:15,545
Yvette has a twin.

392
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,280
Yvette and Rebecca Ellison
were the only children

393
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,849
of Charles Ellison,
who died several months ago.

394
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,118
Charles Ellison-- why does
that name sound familiar?

395
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,153
Shipping magnate,
multimillionaire.

396
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,222
Two parks and a school
named after him.

397
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:27,690
According to this,
Rebecca has run

398
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:30,359
the family's charitable
trust for years.

399
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:31,994
(elevator bell dings)

400
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:34,764
So you think
Casey McManus' neighbor

401
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,832
didn't see Yvette last night,
but her sister?

402
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,234
I daresay
you're getting the hang

403
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:41,203
of deductive reasoning,
Watson.

404
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,305
Excuse me,

405
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:45,908
could you point us in the
direction of Rebecca Ellison?

406
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,278
I'm Rebecca Ellison.

407
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,281
Uh, she has dark hair,
brown eyes, freckles.

408
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:55,818
I'm sorry. I think
you might be confusing me

409
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,586
with my sister Yvette.

410
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:01,256
We're fraternal twins,
not identical.

411
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:02,657
She's, um,
she's not well right now.

412
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:03,825
She's in the hospital.

413
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:05,894
Is there something
I can help you with?

414
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:09,030
We're good. Thanks.

415
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,306
Having fun?

416
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:22,208
Can't you tell?

417
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,711
You're still thinking
about the case.

418
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:27,612
Obviously Yvette Ellison
didn't kill Casey McManus,

419
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,114
but given that his
neighbor picked her

420
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,482
out of a photo array,

421
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,750
it stands to reason
that the real killer

422
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,519
bears a striking resemblance.

423
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:37,188
The question is: who is she and
what did she have against Casey?

424
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,758
Well, is it possible
that Detective Bell was right

425
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,827
and that the neighbor was lying
about seeing the woman

426
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:44,963
on the stairs?

427
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,132
Hey, I found something in
the hall closet the other day.

428
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,834
Was it the zipper mask?

429
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:51,469
'Cause I swear I'm just
holding that for a friend.

430
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,474
It's a trophy from an old case.

431
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,608
Forgot I still had it.

432
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,010
Feel free to bin it.

433
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,545
Uh, I-I know it's yours

434
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,747
because it has "S. Holmes"
engraved under the strings.

435
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,749
So I used to play.
What of it?

436
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,451
Well, I just thought
it might be a nice addition

437
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,419
to your post-rehab
regimen.

438
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,621
Playing an instrument can
relieve a lot of stress.

439
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,389
You think I'm stressed?

440
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,527
I think... you have
a lot on your plate

441
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,729
and you're not going
easy on yourself

442
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,631
with all this work
with the police.

443
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,799
I don't play anymore.

444
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,501
Attic theory.

445
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,437
Playing took up too much space
in my brain, so I stopped.

446
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,871
That doesn't even
make any sense.

447
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,874
You can't unlearn something
you already know.

448
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,609
(phone ringing)

449
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,378
Five bucks says
it's the ex-boyfriend.

450
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,380
Answer it.

451
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,648
I'm not going anywhere.

452
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,084
(ringing continues)

453
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,654
TY: Hey.
Hey.

454
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,922
Bad time?

455
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,190
Uh, not great.

456
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,892
Is everything okay?

457
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,960
Um, what's up?

458
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,497
I just left work and wanted
to see how you were doing.

459
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:53,165
I'm fine.

460
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,267
But you said
it wasn't a good time.

461
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,337
Well, I'm just kind of
in the middle of,

462
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,940
you know, something... What...

463
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,609
Oh, my God. What the hell?

464
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:04,077
Joan?

465
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,245
What is it?
Is everything okay?

466
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,114
Uh, Ty, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

467
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:09,481
You were right about
the stress relief.

468
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,649
I felt like Jimi Hendrix

469
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,051
for a second there.

470
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,619
You didn't have to do that.

471
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,087
Thank you, funny name that.

472
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,590
Noun, verb, nationality.
Stop changing subjects.

473
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:18,851
Stop mucking with my things.

474
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:20,157
I wouldn't have to muck
with your things if you would

475
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,696
open up to me. We're supposed
to learn about each other.

476
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,698
(phone ringing) That's how
companionship works.

477
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,534
Good evening, Captain.

478
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:29,535
How may I help?

479
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,204
Uh, you can meet me in Queens.

480
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:33,539
There's been
another shooting death.

481
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,376
Looks like the same gun
that killed Casey McManus.

482
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,712
Well,
given Casey McManus' neighbor

483
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:41,680
has been in custody
since last night,

484
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,782
I'd say that officially
clears him of the murder,

485
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,784
wouldn't you?
Well, I'm big enough

486
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,352
to admit when I'm wrong.
Doesn't mean he didn't lie

487
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,987
about the neighbor
he claimed to see.

488
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,822
Shooter was seated again.

489
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:52,390
Any thoughts to why?

490
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,830
(sniffs)

491
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:00,333
I smell the same deodorant
I smelled at the first scene.

492
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:02,402
So we know what our killer
smells like.

493
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:05,238
Too bad we can't put out an APB
on an armpit.

494
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,673
WATSON:
Sherlock?

495
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:08,008
You said
the first victim suffered

496
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,076
from corneal dystrophy,
didn't you?

497
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,278
What of it?

498
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,080
This medicine
is used to treat it.

499
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,016
News trucks are here.
Perfect.

500
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:18,452
You want to tell them
we got two victims

501
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:19,519
with no discernible link

502
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:20,954
or should I?

503
00:20:20,956 --> 00:20:24,124
Actually, Captain,
the link is quite discernible.

504
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,062
Both victims suffered
from the same

505
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:30,064
rare genetic disorder:

506
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:31,432
clouding of the corneas.

507
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:32,967
If you ignore skin color
for the moment,

508
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,702
you note the, uh,

509
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,871
the widow's peak,
the bone structure of the face.

510
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:39,273
You tell me they don't look
the least bit familiar.

511
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:43,277
Casey McManus and this woman
were more than just linked.

512
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,747
They were brother and sister.

513
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,840
You were right about
the two victims being related.

514
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:00,507
DNA test showed that
they were half-siblings.

515
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:01,868
Uh, for what it's worth,

516
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,271
the genetic traits here
suggest that

517
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:06,173
the parent they had in common
was the father.

518
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,141
Yeah, our ME said
the same thing,

519
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,542
but according to interviews

520
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:11,210
with the friends
and family members,

521
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:12,978
neither knew
the other one existed.

522
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,507
Casey McManus' mom
had him out of wedlock.

523
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,709
She never told him
who his real dad was.

524
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,010
Ditto for Anna Webster.

525
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,279
Far as they knew,

526
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,914
they were only children.

527
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,449
Both shared a mystery dad.

528
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,451
Both were murdered
within a day of each other.

529
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,853
Obviously not a coincidence.

530
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,120
Do you think maybe

531
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,889
he was the one who killed them?
No.

532
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,523
I still think
the killer's a woman.

533
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,858
But identifying dad

534
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,827
might get us closer
to identifying her.

535
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,028
Surely the victims' mothers

536
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,196
can help on that front.

537
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,664
Yeah, you'd think.

538
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,000
Casey's mom died
in a car accident in '97.

539
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,736
Anna Webster's died
of cancer, 2008.

540
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,238
Neither are talking to anybody.

541
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,673
Just found this.

542
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,777
Anna Webster filed a complaint
a few weeks ago

543
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,946
about a guy she thought
was following her.

544
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:56,814
Saw him parked outside
her home one morning

545
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,917
and snapped a few pictures
from her window.

546
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,719
Now, I'm thinking

547
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,388
maybe that's the father
we're trying to find.

548
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,457
The age is right.

549
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,559
But there's approximately...

550
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:09,061
zero family resemblance.

551
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,996
Not dad, not by a long shot.

552
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,165
I'm pretty sure Holmes
is right on this one.

553
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,566
How?

554
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:19,304
Because believe it or
not, I know this guy.

555
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,739
(tapping on window)

556
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,975
Tommy Gregson,
as I live and breathe!

557
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,410
Ha-ha! How long
has it been, Mike,

558
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:26,179
four or five years?
Hey, Mike, how you been?

559
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:29,115
Eh, take a long around; you tell me.
Mike and I

560
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:30,316
came up together
in the department.

561
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:31,818
Then he got
all high and mighty.

562
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,953
He started working
for the private sector.

563
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,788
Became top investigator for
White Shoe & White Shoe here.

564
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,224
Mike, this is
Detective Bell,

565
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,659
Ms. Watson,
and Mr. Holmes.

566
00:22:39,661 --> 00:22:41,227
MIKE: Yeah,
any of you thirsty?

567
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,595
My girl makes
a killer espresso.

568
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,396
No, actually, we're
sort of on a clock.

569
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:46,098
We were hoping that

570
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,599
you were able
to tell us why you

571
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,968
were trailing this girl
two weeks ago.

572
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,870
Uh...

573
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,306
I haven't seen her before
in my life.

574
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:57,809
Mike.

575
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,013
Um, can't talk about it.

576
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:04,817
It has to do with a case
for one of my firm's clients.

577
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,019
It's protected by privilege.
Mike,

578
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:10,089
this girl got killed last night.
I know.

579
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:11,824
I saw it on the news
and I think it stinks,

580
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:13,525
and she seemed like a good kid,

581
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,736
but you know how it is:
rules are rules.

582
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,229
Mike...

583
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,663
Excuse me.

584
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,398
Sorry, could you just--
excuse me a second--

585
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,867
would you mind just telling me
a little bit more

586
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,135
about this
beautiful plant.

587
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:25,870
You work a lot of
late nights, Mr. McGee.

588
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:28,506
I can tell by your eyes, but
you know what else I can tell

589
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:29,907
is that you've turned
to methamphetamines

590
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,242
to stay awake and alert.

591
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,210
You blink excessively.
Your eyes dart.

592
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,579
You also lost a
great deal of weight

593
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,947
over the last few
months, even though

594
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,148
your diet's as
revolting as ever.

595
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,916
And the fact that your
carotid has started

596
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,651
jumping up and down
like a basketball

597
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,687
makes me think that
your stash is nearby.

598
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,189
It's in your desk, perhaps?

599
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,157
Tell us what we need
to know right now,

600
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,993
and I won't start
throwing your drawers open

601
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:53,598
in front of <i>Captain</i> Gregson
and <i>Detective</i> Bell.

602
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,234
Also, um...

603
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:59,771
when you're ready to get
your life back on track...

604
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,840
Hemdale Rehabilitation Facility

605
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:04,509
gets my very strongest
recommendation.

606
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:06,945
Uh, they even have a pool.

607
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,546
Yeah.

608
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,085
Uh, Tommy, uh...
since you and I

609
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,920
go back a ways,

610
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,855
I'm gonna

611
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:21,058
take this file
and put it on my desk.

612
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,494
I'm gonna go

613
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:24,662
hit the head.

614
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:27,097
You know, whatever
happens in here

615
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,967
while I'm gone,
you know... happens.

616
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,102
Appreciate it, Mike.
Yeah. Sure, Tommy.

617
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,505
Sure.

618
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,981
(horns honk in distance)

619
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,819
Casey McManus

620
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,821
and Anna Webster,

621
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,789
you hired your lawyers
to investigate them

622
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,324
several months ago-- why?

623
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,127
Because
you discovered

624
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:58,629
that Casey and Anna
were your half-siblings.

625
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,832
Your father Charles,
as successful a businessman

626
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,801
as he was potent a philanderer,

627
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:05,304
sired them out of wedlock
decades ago.

628
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:06,672
Paid off their mothers
to keep them quiet.

629
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:07,807
He told you and Yvette

630
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,275
of their existence
on his deathbed.

631
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:10,610
Now they're both dead.

632
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:11,911
Coincidence?

633
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:13,246
I suspect not.

634
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:14,814
What are you talking about?

635
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:16,949
What do you mean,
they're both dead?

636
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,484
What he means, Ms. Ellison,
is that you don't

637
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:20,886
have to worry about them
coming after your money anymore.

638
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:23,088
HOLMES: We know that Charles
left his fortune

639
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,757
to you and Yvette, but he failed
to include language in his will

640
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,158
that would exclude
his bastard children

641
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,893
from laying claim
to their share of it.

642
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,328
That made them
pretermitted heirs

643
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,031
in the eyes of the law,
which meant that

644
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,066
if they ever discovered
their father's true identity,

645
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,468
they'd have been able to sue

646
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,436
for a piece
of his considerable estate,

647
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:40,238
potentially reducing you
and your sister's inheritance

648
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,107
by as much as two-thirds.

649
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:45,143
<i>That's why you hired your</i>
<i>lawyers to investigate them,</i>

650
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,378
<i>and that's why</i>

651
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,814
I believe you killed them.

652
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:50,549
I didn't kill anyone.
Can you account

653
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:51,916
for your whereabouts
the last two nights

654
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,552
between the hours
of 8:00 p.m.

655
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:54,753
and 10:00 p.m.?

656
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,588
I-I was... at home.

657
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,956
I was alone.

658
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,324
(whispers):
That means no.

659
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,492
Maybe it's time

660
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,427
we took this
back to the precinct.

661
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:04,129
REBECCA:
No.

662
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:06,131
No.

663
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:13,239
Look, you're right about my dad.

664
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,140
He did tell me and my sister

665
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:17,543
about Casey and Anna
right before he died.

666
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:19,345
And yes, we knew
they could lay claim

667
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:21,046
to at least part of the estate.

668
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:22,714
It was very difficult for us.

669
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,849
We were very angry with him;
we couldn't believe

670
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,818
he would keep something
like that from us.

671
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,454
But he was very sick, and we...

672
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:30,889
(sighs)

673
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:33,926
After he died,
we went back and forth

674
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,260
about what we should do.

675
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,528
<i>Neither of us wanted to have</i>

676
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,495
<i>to keep his secret,</i>

677
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:39,096
but to give tens of millions

678
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,900
of dollars to two
virtual strangers seemed insane.

679
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,569
<i>That's</i> why we reached
out to his attorneys.

680
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,304
We wanted them to look
into Casey and Anna

681
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,774
so we could have
all the facts at our disposal.

682
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,176
Where they lived, perhaps;
how one might get into their homes.

683
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,577
No. Nothing like that.

684
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,979
We just wanted to know
what kind of people

685
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,681
they were.

686
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,117
But then, before we could
make any sort of decision...

687
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,219
Yvette went into a tailspin.

688
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,255
She... started seeing
a married man,

689
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,124
<i>started drinking.</i>

690
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,927
<i>And then she tried</i>
<i>to kill herself.</i>

691
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,063
The "suicide attempt," right,

692
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:14,765
'cause I'm starting to wonder
if that's what that really was.

693
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,268
I have to assume that
with Yvette out of the way,

694
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,805
you stood to inherit the Ellison
fortune in its entirety.

695
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,174
It wouldn't surprise
me to learn that

696
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:25,178
you found some way to compel
her to take those pills.

697
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,382
I would never hurt my sister.

698
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:30,984
BELL:
Ms. Ellison,

699
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:32,819
if you'll come with us...

700
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:36,022
HOLMES:
Just one thing.

701
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:38,325
Why disguise yourself as Yvette
to commit the murders?

702
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,360
The witness saw you
at the first scene,

703
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:42,562
but he described
your sister to a T.

704
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:44,898
I-I know that you're
a fraternal twin,

705
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,333
but with a wig, bit of a makeup,

706
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:47,767
you bear more than
a passing resemblance.

707
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,335
The question is,
why would you want to?

708
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:51,070
What was the point
of trying to frame

709
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:52,705
a woman in a coma?

710
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:53,973
You even put on her deodorant.

711
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:56,176
Master stroke,
when you think about it.

712
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:58,178
You're insane.

713
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:09,457
(horn beeping nearby)

714
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,225
She really got you, huh?

715
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:13,995
Lefty. Caught me by surprise.

716
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:16,297
This one, leathery from slaps.

717
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,466
This one, baby's bottom.

718
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:27,108
Ty, what the hell
are you doing here?

719
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,443
What do you mean, what
the hell am I doing here?

720
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,379
Dinner, remember?
You said 6:00.

721
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:33,747
I didn't say anything. How
did you even find this place?

722
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:35,015
Your e-mail-- you said
your friend's having

723
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,550
a dinner party, I should come.
Ty!

724
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:37,918
Such a pleasure.

725
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,854
Joan's told me
so little about you.

726
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:41,022
You hacked my e-mail?

727
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,290
"Hack" is such an ugly word.

728
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:43,191
Joan, what's going on?

729
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:44,459
What does it look like, Ty?

730
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,394
It's a soiree.

731
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:46,595
Not sure about this, though.

732
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:48,063
Bit of a party foul.
Unless...

733
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:49,965
You know what?
This was a mistake.

734
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:52,168
I don't understand.
Who is that guy?

735
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,537
He's my...

736
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,205
he's my friend,
and he's a prankster,

737
00:28:56,207 --> 00:28:58,808
(laughs): and he brought you here
to mess with me.

738
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,143
So...
He's your boyfriend.

739
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:01,344
No.

740
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:02,879
Wow. Uh, not even close.

741
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:04,847
You know what? I am so sorry.
I'm gonna call you

742
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,050
tomorrow, okay?
I backed out of drinks with the DA

743
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:08,518
for this.
Tell your friend

744
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,254
he's lucky I didn't slug him.

745
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:13,556
(sighs)

746
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:15,758
(quietly): If you ever do,
swing from the left.

747
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,895
Where's he going?
Was it something I said?

748
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:22,299
Invading my privacy, not okay.

749
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,600
Said the walking, talking

750
00:29:23,602 --> 00:29:25,102
professional invasion
of privacy.

751
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:26,570
I am here to work with you.

752
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:28,439
I thought you
understood that by now.

753
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,707
I'm sorry, wasn't it you
that said we were

754
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,643
supposed to be learning more
about each other?

755
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,011
That's how companionship
works, is it not?

756
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:34,479
Is this because
of the violin yesterday?

757
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,181
Because I think
you made your point

758
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:37,649
when you set it on <i>fire!</i>

759
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,817
Well, I haven't made my point

760
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,751
unless you've absorbed it.

761
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:40,886
Friendship
is not a requirement

762
00:29:40,888 --> 00:29:42,253
of cohabitation.

763
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:43,955
I'll keep my secrets;
you keep yours.

764
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,723
Provided I'm still sober
in five weeks,

765
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:47,225
we'll go our separate ways, hmm?

766
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:51,229
(phone ringing)

767
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:52,897
Holmes.

768
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,899
It's Captain Gregson.
Just thought you should know

769
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:56,334
we're letting
Rebecca Ellison go.

770
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,568
What?

771
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,505
Searches of
her home and business

772
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,939
didn't turn up anything

773
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:03,841
and security cameras
at her apartment

774
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,711
confirm she <i>was</i> there
at the time of each murder

775
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:08,246
just like she said she was.

776
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:10,314
She enters before 7:00
both nights

777
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,716
and doesn't leave
until the next morning.

778
00:30:12,718 --> 00:30:16,553
She didn't kill Casey McManus
<i>or</i> Anna Webster.

779
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,542
u guys know being up here
is, uh, it's a big step,

780
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:30,877
and part of me is...

781
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,112
(quietly):
I can't believe

782
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:33,880
that with everything
we have to do,

783
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:36,115
you have dragged me to
another addict festival.

784
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:39,453
We have nowhere else to be
for the next 45 minutes

785
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:40,987
but here at this meeting.

786
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:42,522
She tricked them.

787
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,925
I don't know how yet,
but she tricked them.

788
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,694
Rebecca Ellison.

789
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:48,296
I still think
she's the one

790
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,200
that murdered Casey McManus
and Anna Webster.

791
00:30:52,202 --> 00:30:55,703
Hmm? Would you rather I put
myself in another trance?

792
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:58,106
I already thought of that.

793
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,108
Got it off the board over there.

794
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,610
You even think
about zoning out,

795
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,612
it goes into the softest part
of your thigh.

796
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,415
(whispers):
Lots of nerve endings there.

797
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,616
You wouldn't dare.

798
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:11,052
MODERATOR:
Who'd like to go next?

799
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,457
My name is Elaine,
and I'm an addict.

800
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,159
OTHERS: Hi, Elaine.
(mumbles)

801
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:20,661
ELAINE:
I am exactly

802
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:23,163
360 days sober.

803
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,532
Five more, and I hit
my one-year mark.

804
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:27,367
I know I-I should be proud.

805
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,269
I know I should be excited,
but I can't be.

806
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:32,872
Because I'm not the only one

807
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:35,609
whose life was ruined
by my addiction.

808
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:37,377
My drug was...

809
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:39,513
(quietly): I'm playing
the violin again.

810
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:41,615
The world's smallest.

811
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:44,084
Well, I thought
you'd be happy.

812
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:50,191
Which is why I decided
to latch on to a doctor instead.

813
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:53,461
I met this great guy,

814
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:55,563
Steven, a GP,

815
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:59,000
and I acted like I was
all into him, you know?

816
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,602
He was married.

817
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:03,305
He had three
beautiful daughters.

818
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:04,773
But I didn't care about that.

819
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:07,376
All I cared about was me
and what <i>I</i> needed.

820
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:10,445
When we were together, it was
like I didn't even see him.

821
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,113
All I saw were the drugs.

822
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:16,017
And eventually, his wife
found out and called the police,

823
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,252
(crying):
and...

824
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:20,320
even though I was the one
who started it all,

825
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,756
he was the one who went to jail.

826
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:24,658
You see, he had taken an oath.

827
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,828
He promised to do no harm.

828
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,898
But what about the harm
I did to him?

829
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,201
We have to leave.
What?

830
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,136
You know you're required by your
father to attend these meetings.

831
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,172
I just had a breakthrough
regarding the investigation,

832
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:42,108
and you want me to sit in a room
and tell stories like a child.

833
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,376
You don't think I know
you'd say anything

834
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,544
to get out of these meetings?

835
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,112
If you think these matter,

836
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:47,579
then fine, tomorrow
I'll go to two, or ten,

837
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:50,049
but right now I have
a killer to stop.

838
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,951
Tell me what your breakthrough is.
What?

839
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:54,287
You said you had some sort
of breakthrough-- what is it?

840
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:55,755
Now, look, there isn't
time for this!

841
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:57,824
We need to find out where
Rebecca Ellison is right now.

842
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:59,059
You said earlier
we don't need

843
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,360
to be friends,
and you're right.

844
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:02,128
But we do need
to trust each other.

845
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,431
Tell me what's going on,
and I will try and help you.

846
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:07,635
Don't, and I will be
the opposite of help.

847
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:09,837
REBECCA:
<i>"For I consider brains</i>

848
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,205
"far superior to money
in every way.

849
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,540
You may have noticed
that if one..."

850
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,108
Murderer!

851
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,010
You may have
fooled the police.

852
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,411
You didn't fool me.

853
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,779
I know that you're the one

854
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,181
who killed Casey McManus
and Anna Webster.

855
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:23,516
Get out. Right now.
Nurse!

856
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:25,051
The surveillance cameras
in your building.

857
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:28,087
The ones that support
your so-called "alibi."

858
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,155
You tampered with them somehow.
MAN: What's going on in here?

859
00:33:30,157 --> 00:33:31,890
HOLMES: I'm on to you, Ms. Ellison.
Matter of fact,

860
00:33:31,892 --> 00:33:33,291
I'm way ahead of you.

861
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:36,161
I know all about the third
pretermitted heir.

862
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:37,195
What?
Daddy's third bastard.

863
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:39,464
I figured out who she is.

864
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:41,599
Mary Margaret Phelps.
80-33 West Tremont, Morris Heights.

865
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:43,601
Don't pretend like you
don't already know.

866
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:47,338
You're not that good an actress.
Holmes, back away.

867
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,006
WATSON: When I couldn't talk you
out of coming,

868
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:50,274
I texted him.
Yes, that's right.

869
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:52,543
The opposite of help.
Thank you.

870
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:54,078
You know what?
It doesn't matter

871
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,313
because as of tonight,

872
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:57,515
Mary Margaret has
her own personal bodyguard.

873
00:33:57,517 --> 00:33:59,918
Me. I'll be watching her
24/7,

874
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,220
and I won't let you
anywhere near her.

875
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:03,454
That's enough.
Get off!

876
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:05,923
BELL: Okay.
(groans)

877
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:07,425
That's it. Come on.

878
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:09,227
You just assaulted
a police officer,

879
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:11,762
which means you

880
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:13,564
get to spend the night
in jail. Let's go.

881
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:15,700
You haven't seen the last
of me, Ms. Ellison.

882
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:17,869
Not by a long shot.

883
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:20,037
I will not let you hurt the third heir!
Excuse me.

884
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,673
Do you understand me?
I will not let you hurt her!

885
00:34:22,675 --> 00:34:24,141
BELL:
Let's go.

886
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:47,098
(door creaks)

887
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:21,699
(lock clicks open)

888
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:27,972
(beeping)

889
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:42,687
GREGSON:
Put the gun down, Ms. Ellison.

890
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,829
Or do you prefer Yvette?

891
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:53,732
REBECCA:
<i>I don't understand.</i>

892
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,567
She was in a coma.

893
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:56,768
Now she's fine?

894
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,671
It wasn't a
regular coma.

895
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:01,440
It was medically induced
by her doctor.

896
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:04,576
He put her in and
brought her out as needed.

897
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:07,479
To kill Casey and Anna.

898
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:09,081
I don't understand.
Why would he...

899
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,483
Because he was
the married man

900
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,652
with whom
she was having an affair.

901
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:15,154
Obviously, she never
introduced you.

902
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:17,090
Because he was also
part of her plan

903
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,327
to protect her money from her
father's illegitimate children.

904
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,064
When I met him
the other day,

905
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,833
I noticed a pale stripe
of skin on his finger.

906
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,536
<i>Clearly, he'd recently stopped</i>
<i>wearing his wedding band.</i>

907
00:36:28,538 --> 00:36:30,572
Didn't think anything
of it in the moment,

908
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:32,240
but then at a, um,

909
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:34,075
a gathering I attended

910
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:36,211
this evening,
I heard the story

911
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:37,813
of a woman
who seduced her doctor

912
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:40,583
to take advantage
of his medical expertise.

913
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:42,518
And it got me thinking

914
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,253
about you and your sister's
predicament.

915
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:47,390
Two heiresses learn
of the existence

916
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:49,391
of two half-siblings days before

917
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:52,828
they're set to receive their
rather massive inheritance.

918
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,031
One has a big heart,

919
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:59,167
the other...
Hmm.

920
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:01,736
Big heart wants to share.

921
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:03,304
Get to know these people.

922
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:04,439
Welcome them as family,

923
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,975
and share with them
her many blessings.

924
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:09,645
Little heart would
rather see them dead.

925
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:11,947
Problem is she knows

926
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:14,750
that only she and
one other person, her sister,

927
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:16,518
have motive to kill them.

928
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,086
She also knows that this motive,

929
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:21,890
in time, could easily
be traced back to her.

930
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,059
So what does she do?
She finds herself

931
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:27,029
an alibi that is
beyond reproach.

932
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:28,730
She enlists the help
of someone with the knowledge

933
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:30,299
and the expertise

934
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:33,302
<i>to not only help her</i>
<i>stage a suicide attempt,</i>

935
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:36,271
<i>but ease her into a coma.</i>

936
00:37:36,273 --> 00:37:38,841
Yvette's doctor was arrested
a little while ago.

937
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:40,342
He confessed to giving
her barbiturates

938
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:42,278
to keep her unconscious,
not only to trick

939
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,846
the machines
that monitored her,

940
00:37:43,848 --> 00:37:45,749
but also anyone who would want
to examine her

941
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:47,150
when he wasn't around.

942
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:50,720
Hmm. It wasn't a perfect
plan, of course.

943
00:37:50,722 --> 00:37:52,489
Between the drugs
and the atrophied muscles,

944
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:53,990
she was quite weak.

945
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:55,325
<i>That's why she was seated</i>

946
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:57,727
<i>when she shot Casey and Anna.</i>

947
00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:00,763
Because, in the moment,
it was too difficult to stand.

948
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:03,733
I never told you that I wanted
to share the money

949
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:06,202
and Yvette didn't.

950
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:07,671
How did you know?

951
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:10,240
Why else would she go
to these lengths?

952
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,610
And what about the third heir?

953
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:15,845
The one whose house
Yvette broke into.

954
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:18,214
Is she okay?
She's fine.

955
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:20,683
In that she never existed.

956
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:21,918
I, I made her up.

957
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,486
WATSON: What you saw
at the hospital,

958
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,854
none of it was real.

959
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:26,355
It was a trap.

960
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:27,957
<i>I made a commotion to draw</i>

961
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,491
<i>Yvette's doctor in.</i>

962
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,426
I announced the name and address
of the heir.

963
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:34,129
<i>Mary Margaret Phelps,</i>
<i>80-33 West Tremont,</i>

964
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:35,463
so that he'd have them.

965
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:37,065
I then "assaulted"

966
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,466
<i>Detective Bell</i>

967
00:38:38,468 --> 00:38:40,201
so the good doctor
would think that I,

968
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:42,103
the only apparent threat
to his and Yvette's plan,

969
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:44,172
<i>was in jail for the night,</i>
<i>allowing them</i>

970
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:46,707
a very crucial window
of opportunity.

971
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:48,409
And they took it.

972
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,711
Because even though

973
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:52,313
neither of them
had even heard

974
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:53,714
of the third heir
before tonight,

975
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:55,650
they couldn't
take any chances.

976
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:58,119
As for the woman Yvette
trailed to her home...

977
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:01,589
she's an officer here
at the precinct.

978
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,296
I have to contact
our attorneys.

979
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:10,331
I need to see if
they can help her.

980
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,800
I know what she did

981
00:39:12,802 --> 00:39:14,469
is unforgivable,

982
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:16,971
but she is still my sister.
There were only

983
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:19,040
two pretermitted heirs,
Ms. Ellison.

984
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,175
Yvette killed
the second one yesterday.

985
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:22,877
So tell me:

986
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,046
Why was she still
in a coma today?

987
00:39:25,048 --> 00:39:29,017
Why didn't she miraculously
wake up this morning?

988
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:32,754
Who did she have
left to kill?

989
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:34,723
Do you think, perhaps,
it was someone who stood

990
00:39:34,725 --> 00:39:36,758
between her and the entirety

991
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,461
of the family fortune?

992
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:47,703
You mind that big heart,
Ms. Ellison.

993
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:50,906
It'll beat longer.

994
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,745
GREGSON:
You taking off?

995
00:39:57,747 --> 00:39:59,146
Case is closed,
is it not?

996
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:00,814
It is.

997
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,416
Which is why you should come
join us for drinks in a bit.

998
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:05,318
Bell here is buying.

999
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,720
I'm under orders.

1000
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:08,254
That said, I, uh,

1001
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:10,623
appreciate the help
you gave us.

1002
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:13,226
GREGSON:
So what do you say?

1003
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:14,794
Drinks?

1004
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:15,929
In about an hour?

1005
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:18,398
Another time, perhaps.

1006
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,333
All right.

1007
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:28,474
More malodorous takeout.
How wonderful.

1008
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:30,809
What is this?
Five nights in a row?

1009
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:32,978
It's Mediterranean.
I hope you like garlic.

1010
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,913
You'd think
that for what

1011
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,149
my father is paying you,
you'd learn to cook.

1012
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:39,718
(chuckles)

1013
00:40:41,954 --> 00:40:43,622
What?
You want to talk

1014
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:46,325
about what happened in
the support meeting tonight?

1015
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,893
Something happened?

1016
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:49,528
You listened.
You let

1017
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,430
someone else's
natterings penetrate

1018
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:52,598
that attic you call a skull

1019
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,933
and it helped you
catch a killer.

1020
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:57,537
You want a thank you?
Fine. Thank you.

1021
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:03,978
Do you you close
yourself off to people

1022
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,748
and deny yourself things that
might bring you pleasure...

1023
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,385
not because it makes you
a better investigator,

1024
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:12,886
but because it's
some sort of penance?

1025
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,455
Penance?

1026
00:41:14,457 --> 00:41:16,223
For what happened in London.

1027
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,725
Being addicted.

1028
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,895
I don't know.
I guess it just occurred to me

1029
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,163
that it might be something

1030
00:41:22,165 --> 00:41:24,432
that someone might do
and not even know it.

1031
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:28,403
Well, you always know it,
Watson.

1032
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:31,373
If you didn't,

1033
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,008
it wouldn't be penance.
