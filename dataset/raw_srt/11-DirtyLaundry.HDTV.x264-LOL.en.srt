00:00:02,256 --> 00:00:04,907
(kettle whistling)

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,547
Are we completely out of mugs?

3
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:13,249
HOLMES:
Check the sink.

4
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:15,584
These are ready
for carbon dating.

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:18,587
Ugh... I take it we're
out of clean bowls, too?

6
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,273
And forks and
plates and cups.

7
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:23,142
Where am I supposed
to put my tea?

8
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,644
This isn't healthy,
you know.

9
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:27,263
Little marinara is not gonna
kill you, Watson.

10
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:28,781
No, I mean the state
of your kitchen.

11
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:30,533
Don't you mean
<i>our</i> kitchen?

12
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:31,817
No, I mean yours.

13
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:34,103
I'm only here for ten
more days, remember?

14
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,772
Nine days, 12 hours, 47 minutes,

15
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:38,440
actually, but who's counting?

16
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:40,877
I'm just saying,
this is a problem.

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,746
<i>This</i> is the sign
of an active mind.

18
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:45,665
Lincoln,
Einstein, Freud.

19
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,633
All geniuses
who drew inspiration

20
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:50,169
from chaos in their environs.

21
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:52,288
Without Andrew Fleming's
reluctance to wash petri dishes,

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,007
the world wouldn't have
penicillin, would it?

23
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,809
Well, since the world does,
do you have to grow it

24
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:58,010
in your fridge?

25
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:02,515
(sighs)
Nine days, 12 hours, 46 minutes.

Victim's name
is Teri Purcell.

32
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,766
She's General Manager
of this hotel.

33
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,454
She worked late most nights
in her office.

34
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:08,657
That's where she
was last seen.

35
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,794
Looks like she died from
blunt-force trauma to the head,

36
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,712
and then she got stuffed
in the machine

37
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:15,597
to wash away any
physical evidence.

38
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,350
The washer makes it hard to
pinpoint time of death.

39
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,668
Best guess right now
is somewhere between

40
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,220
9:30 and midnight.

41
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:23,389
Machine was wiped down,
so there's no fingerprints,

42
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:25,307
except for the maid's
who found her,

43
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:27,860
and no witnesses,
either.

44
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,847
And this?
Fountain pen.

45
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,315
It was found in
the washing machine

46
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:35,033
with the body
and some sheets.

47
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,319
Now, could be the victim's,
could be the killer's.

48
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,688
No way to tell 'cause
there aren't any prints.

49
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,358
Broken in half,
and yet I see no ink at all

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,794
on Mrs. Purcell's person,
or the sheets

51
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:47,413
that were in the washer.

52
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:50,332
I'm gonna go out on a limb,
and say it was empty.

53
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,669
I noticed that neither the
security camera in the corridor

54
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:56,305
nor the one by the exit
door are functioning.

55
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:57,539
The red power
lights were off.

56
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,724
Yeah, hotel
maintenance said

57
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:00,876
they've been inactive
for months.

58
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,228
They keep fixing them,
they keep going on the fritz.

59
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,046
Which means the attacker
could come and go

60
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:06,815
without fear of
being monitored.

61
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,384
Suggests they were familiar
with the environment.

62
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,052
As for these

63
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:13,155
drag marks here,

64
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:16,158
a distinctive maroon color from
the heels of the victim's shoes.

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,060
Similar marks running
the length of the corridor,

66
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:21,413
meaning she was dragged here
from somewhere else.

67
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:23,248
You mentioned an office?

68
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:28,003
Obviously, it looks like
the altercation

69
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,955
may have started here.

70
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:31,423
Not likely a robbery
gone wrong.

71
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:33,342
No drawers ransacked

72
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,743
or cabinets left open.

73
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,428
BELL: Well, so far,
all the hotel staff

74
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,797
we've talked to said
Mrs. Purcell is a great boss.

75
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,915
Everyone loved her.

76
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,717
Hm. Because people
are so eager

77
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,353
to speak ill of the dead,
aren't they?

78
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,054
The walls are lined
with awards

79
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:48,357
and letters of appreciation
for all her charity work.

80
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,775
Yes, well, we're
not so keen

81
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:51,927
to advertise our
shameful acts, are we?

82
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:54,980
No, Mrs. Purcell
wanted to be seen

83
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:56,899
as a friendly,
welcoming person.

84
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:58,901
It's not enough for
her to be altruistic,

85
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,319
she wants to be
acknowledged for it.

86
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:02,204
Same goes with
her family.

87
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,655
Here's an observation
for you.

88
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,707
More often than not,
when I find a murdered woman

89
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,042
with a wedding band
on her finger,

90
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:08,460
the husband's
the one who did it.

91
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:09,912
I say we talk
to Mr. Purcell,

92
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:12,548
find out
where he was tonight.

93
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:16,301
(dog barking)

94
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,453
Ah, suburbia.

95
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,455
Surprised you haven't tried
to get me to move here

96
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:21,723
in the interest
of my sobriety.

97
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,458
All the "structure"
on display.

98
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,810
Mock me all you want.

99
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:26,361
Organization is
a form of structure,

100
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,313
and structure is good
for recovery.

101
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,516
After you complained
about the state of the kitchen

102
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:32,518
last night, I took
a personal inventory.

103
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,485
Assessed myself.

104
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:35,270
I am excelling
at recovery.

105
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,155
Which tells me that you're
only taking a grim view

106
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,607
of my progress
because you're annoyed

107
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:41,276
that I'm doing so well.
Right.

108
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:42,644
I'm upset by
your success,

109
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:45,113
which is, by association,
my success.

110
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:46,498
Success at a job
that you don't enjoy.

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,483
As opposed to my work,
which invigorates you.

112
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,319
I never denied that I find
what you do very interesting.

113
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,338
I've decided, Watson:
the lessons can continue

114
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,490
after our companionship ends.

115
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:56,842
A weekly salon, perhaps.

116
00:04:56,844 --> 00:04:59,011
You could come by,
I could share my wisdom.

117
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:01,096
In exchange for some light
housework, of course.

118
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:03,999
GREGSON:
Holmes.

119
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,988
I don't know what to say.
Everybody loved Teri.

120
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,974
My poor daughter
is devastated.

121
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:14,560
Neither one of us can figure out
why anyone would hurt her.

122
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:17,312
GREGSON: Mr. Purcell,
we-we have to ask:

123
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:19,114
how was your relationship
with your wife?

124
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:20,348
Everything good?

125
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,850
PURCELL:
Are you asking me that

126
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:23,518
because you think
I did it?

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,071
No, no, we're just trying
to get the whole picture.

128
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:28,490
I loved my wife.
(sighs)

129
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:31,126
Things have been as great
as they always were.

130
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:33,361
Yet you've been sleeping
on the couch lately.

131
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:35,530
The cushions are compressed

132
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:37,749
all the way across,
not just in the middle,

133
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,418
like they are when
someone sits on them.

134
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,719
Someone of your
height and weight

135
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,304
has been lying there
for long periods.

136
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:43,705
I have insomnia.

137
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:46,258
I can watch TV out here
without keeping Teri up.

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,093
That's very
considerate of you.

139
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,729
And... untrue.

140
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:53,181
The damp towels and the presence
of your toiletries

141
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:56,885
in the guest bathroom--
they suggest that your wife

142
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:57,986
has banished you completely

143
00:05:57,988 --> 00:05:59,655
from the master
bedroom.

144
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,356
(scoffs)
No.

145
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,442
Stress in the marriage
is to be expected,

146
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:05,277
given your current
unemployment.

147
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,495
Wait, I'm sorry.
H-How did you...

148
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,113
Movie ticket.
It's, uh...

149
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:09,848
Yesterday.
Monday.

150
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,500
It's for a matinee.

151
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:14,036
HOLMES: Hmm? Also, your
printer is full

152
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:15,337
of high-end card stock.

153
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,622
That's... that's
resume paper.

154
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:17,706
You're looking for a job.

155
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,074
Dad?

156
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,592
Are you okay?

157
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,010
Carly, hon,

158
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:24,262
could you please get
our guests some water?

159
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,714
Yeah.

160
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:28,517
Yeah, of course.

161
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,053
I'll give you a hand.
Thank you.

162
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:35,057
Yes, my wife and I have been
having problems, and yes,

163
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,109
I lost my job
as a financial consultant.

164
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:39,945
Which is why I spent yesterday
evening at a Pink Slip Mixer

165
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:42,280
with some other
unemployed friends.

166
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,202
Early admission
to Georgetown and Michigan.

167
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,488
Congratulations. Your mom
must have been really proud.

168
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,605
Yeah.

169
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:52,541
She was.
Looks like you're

170
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,959
a pretty serious
soccer player.

171
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,494
The coach at Michigan

172
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:56,995
promised me
that I'd start.

173
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:58,463
But my mom, she really had

174
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:01,249
her heart set on Georgetown.

175
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,669
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,954
Hey...

177
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,558
I keep telling myself,

178
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,512
"Tough times don't last,
tough people do""

179
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,231
And, "this too shall pass""

180
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,599
"This too shall pass."

181
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,801
"Living one day at a time."

182
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:24,406
I know a lot of people
in recovery.

183
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,476
Yeah.

184
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,662
Um...

185
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:35,500
A couple of years ago,
I... I hurt my knee.

186
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,335
So...

187
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:39,621
I started taking pain
pills just to, like,

188
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,206
get through games.

189
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,675
But by the end of the season,
I was just taking them

190
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,343
to get through the day, and...

191
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:48,163
My mom is the one
who helped me get clean.

192
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:51,016
You know, I'm gonna give you

193
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:52,184
my phone number.

194
00:07:52,186 --> 00:07:53,919
If you need to talk,
my phone's on

195
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,104
all the time.

196
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,512
Waste of time, that was.

197
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:06,364
What?

198
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,949
Coming here.

199
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:10,068
He clearly has great
confidence in his alibi.

200
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,070
And when I look at him,
I don't see "killer""

201
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:14,539
I see "blah."

202
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,524
You want the scoop
on our victim?

203
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:17,576
Talk to her.

204
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:20,162
HOLMES:
She's worth talking to because?

205
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:22,664
She's trimming an evergreen
in the middle of winter.

206
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,365
You're supposed
to do it June.

207
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,917
And the only
thing more important

208
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,535
than a well-maintained lawn
in the suburbs

209
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,020
is gossip.

210
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,306
Teri was .

211
00:08:31,308 --> 00:08:33,041
Lots of people
thought so.

212
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:35,877
Men, especially.

213
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,929
Uh, was there any
particular man

214
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,681
you're referring to?

215
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:42,184
Oh, I wouldn't want
to speak out of school.

216
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:43,819
Course you wouldn't.

217
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,387
I think Teri
was having an affair.

218
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:48,857
A very handsome man
used to drop by a lot.

219
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,892
Always when Oliver
wasn't home.

220
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:52,577
Before he lost his job,
of course.

221
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,579
Could you describe him?

222
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,698
Oh, I can do better than that.

223
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,235
My, uh, friend Sheila
lives over on Oxford.

224
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:02,170
She refused to believe me
when I told her

225
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,572
that "Saint Teri" was
entertaining a gentleman caller.

226
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:06,875
So I took this picture as proof.

227
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:08,093
Hm.

228
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,094
Like I said:

229
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:11,680
handsome, right?

230
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:14,132
His license plate is
particularly fetching.

231
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:20,522
MAN: I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm just... I'm stunned.

232
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,276
Teri was an...
she was an amazing person.

233
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,648
She volunteered here
from the very beginning.

234
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,432
Please.

235
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:34,102
In that time and with her help,
our organization

236
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:37,539
raised money to collect
and destroy over one million

237
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,990
undetonated land mines.

238
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,243
She was as passionate

239
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,295
about our cause as
anyone I've ever known.

240
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:45,247
Is that all that she
was passionate about?

241
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,499
Uh, I'm not sure
what you're asking.

242
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:48,917
Intercourse.

243
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,752
Were you and Teri
having it?

244
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:53,004
I assume you're referring
to the conversational variety.

245
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,756
No, I meant fornication.

246
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:56,958
The insertion of part A into part...
Mr. Silver,

247
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,226
we are not here

248
00:09:58,228 --> 00:09:59,761
to judge you.
Perish the thought!

249
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:02,597
No, we're just... simply
inquiring if your time

250
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,816
with Mrs. Purcell
involved coitus.

251
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:08,019
No. It did not.

252
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,155
Her neighbor seems to be
under the impression it did.

253
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:12,991
She said you had a habit of visiting
when Teri's husband was away.

254
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:15,110
Well, I visited when he
was there, too.

255
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:16,644
Oliver was a friend;
I've known him

256
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:18,113
for as long
as I've known Teri.

257
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:20,148
Can you account
for your whereabouts

258
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,649
between 9:00 and midnight
last night?

259
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:23,919
Yes. A friend and his wife
had me over for dinner.

260
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:27,322
Why?
We'd just like to call and confirm.

261
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:28,790
So, if you
wouldn't mind.

262
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,425
Okay.

263
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,630
I don't really care what
you think about me,

264
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,049
but you got the wrong
idea about Teri.

265
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:40,168
She was as devoted
to her family

266
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,670
as she was to this foundation.

267
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:45,140
She was, without doubt,
one of the finest human beings

268
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:47,559
I've ever had the pleasure
of knowing.

269
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:49,110
Another suspect,

270
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:50,812
another alibi.

271
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:53,181
You're angry because that man
and the husband could prove

272
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:54,649
they didn't commit a murder?

273
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:56,451
I'm angry because I've
run out of suspects.

274
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,119
At least, for
the time being.

275
00:10:58,121 --> 00:10:59,621
I really liked
that one, too.

276
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:01,022
Oily.

277
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,792
He helps run a charity
that dismantles landmines.

278
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:05,210
John Wayne Gacy
gave his time

279
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:06,494
to several charitable
foundations.

280
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,830
Does that make him
a good person, too?

281
00:11:08,832 --> 00:11:10,415
So, that was the captain.

282
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,051
He talked to head of security
at Teri Purcell's hotel.

283
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:15,887
Now he said they had
a prostitution problem recently.

284
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:19,057
Some guests got solicited
in the hotel bar and complained.

285
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,927
Now, Teri cracked down,
cleared out the working girls.

286
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,346
A few weeks later, she gets some
threatening anonymous calls.

287
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:26,014
Probably from
their pimps.

288
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,515
Yeah, I'm gonna
head to Vice,

289
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:29,717
see who might be running
hookers at high-end hotels.

290
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,820
You want to come?

291
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,688
I appreciate the
offer, Detective,

292
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,275
but I've just realized that
Watson and I have a thing.

293
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:39,110
All right.

294
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:40,578
Mm.

295
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,163
A thing?

296
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,115
Why go to Vice to
explore the problem

297
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,401
when we can go
directly to the source?

298
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:49,955
Tell me, have you ever
been whore-fishing?

299
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:52,924
Her?

300
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,410
Too obvious.
Too intoxicated.

301
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,128
High-end escorts

302
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,630
are more polished, discreet.

303
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:01,416
Mark my words. No one
is going to take you seriously

304
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:04,302
as an investigator if
you can't spot a <i>fille de joie</i>

305
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:05,920
at 20 paces.

306
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:07,588
What is the point of this again?

307
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,090
As Detective Bell suggested.

308
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:10,442
If Teri Purcell ran afoul

309
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:12,110
of the working girls
in her establishment,

310
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:14,112
it may well have led
to her death.

311
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,697
Who better to fill in the holes,

312
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,449
as it were,
than the strumpets themselves?

313
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:19,451
Teri Purcell is the one

314
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,619
who put a ban on them
in the hotel.

315
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,604
And how do you know
any of these women are...?

316
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,773
(whispers):
...are call girls?

317
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:28,776
When the cat's away,
the mice will play.

318
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,246
In this case, the cat
got his skull caved in.

319
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,664
The mice are
the prostitutes.

320
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,299
I get it. I just think

321
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,051
your mouse hunt
is a little misogynistic.

322
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:38,753
Not misogynistic.
Anthropological.

323
00:12:38,755 --> 00:12:41,256
The species we are
looking for is attractive,

324
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,808
well-dressed,
quick to laugh,

325
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,960
and highly-skilled at
spotting out-of-town men

326
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:49,681
whose desires are not
being fulfilled at home.

327
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:51,966
Like her.

328
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,241
Excuse me.

329
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,494
Might we offer you a drink
and some company?

330
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:03,945
Oh, a drink
would be lovely.

331
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,747
Excellent.
Now that's out of the way.

332
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:08,249
My friend and I were
wondering what you might charge

333
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,284
to sleep with us.

334
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,818
Just kidding.

335
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,670
We work with the police,
and, uh, we were wondering

336
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:14,956
if you or any of your fellow
working girls might know

337
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,824
who killed the manager
in the hotel last night.

338
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:20,261
Oh, I'm sorry. I think that
you have wrong idea about me.

339
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:21,629
Do I now? I know your clothes--

340
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:22,997
they say
sophisticated businesswoman,

341
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,799
but the faint line
across your thighs says

342
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:26,267
garter belt
with stockings.

343
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,169
And you've made
meaningful eye contact

344
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:30,021
with almost every unattached man
in here, even the paunchy ones.

345
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:31,306
Now, should I alert

346
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,673
security to your presence,

347
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,342
or would you mind
just-just answering

348
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,694
just a couple of questions, hmm?

349
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,114
What do you want
to know?

350
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:42,650
As I said, the manager of the
hotel was killed last night.

351
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:45,320
We're investigating
the possibility

352
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,788
that one of your managers

353
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,206
may have had something
to do with it.

354
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,025
Why would any of those guys
want to kill Teri?

355
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:53,495
So, you knew her?
Of course.

356
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:55,130
We all did.
But trust me,

357
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:58,049
none of our managers would
ever lay a finger on her.

358
00:13:58,051 --> 00:13:59,417
Not in a million years.

359
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:02,103
How can you be so sure?

360
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:06,874
Because... she was the reason
that most of us worked here.

361
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,727
We were told that
she-she chased you all out

362
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,764
because some of the
hotel guests complained.

363
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,933
Oh, she just helped us
to keep a lower profile.

364
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,518
She would sneak us
in the back,

365
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,554
put us up in the service
elevators to meet the clients.

366
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:21,322
She wanted us here.

367
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:23,241
(clears throat)

368
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:27,779
Now, if you two decide
you ever do want a date...

369
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:30,115
call me.

370
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:32,750
I think
we'd have some fun.

371
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,916
GREGSON: So far, every hooker
we've talked to has said the same thing.

372
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:56,949
Ever since Teri Purcell
took over the hotel in '09,

373
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,060
she's been arranging
dates with rich businessmen

374
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,344
and diplomats that were
visiting from the UN.

375
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:05,013
Couple of months ago,
someone started complaining

376
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:07,299
about the prostitutes
in the lobby.

377
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,468
So she started moving them
through the laundry area,

378
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,103
where she'd sabotaged
the security cameras.

379
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:12,670
When their
business was complete,

380
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:14,222
she'd sneak 'em back out.

381
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,174
Now, get ready
for the weird part.

382
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,642
She did it all for free.

383
00:15:17,644 --> 00:15:19,978
You're saying she was
a volunteer madam?

384
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,314
According to the girls
who worked there,

385
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:25,767
yeah-- their pimps loved her.
What about

386
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,185
the threatening phone calls
she received?

387
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,904
They say that they came
from the one girl

388
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:30,372
that she did have to ban.

389
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:31,689
The girl got high in the lobby,

390
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,408
made a scene,
so she had to cut her off.

391
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,193
We tracked her down.

392
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,379
She's six months
into a bid for possession,

393
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:38,747
so she's not our killer.

394
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:42,200
Wyatt? Excuse me.

395
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,835
I don't get it.

396
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:45,720
Why would Teri Purcell
risk her career

397
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:48,373
to run a non-profit brothel
out of her hotel?

398
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,542
House of secrets,
that place.

399
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:54,212
Perhaps it warrants
a second look.

400
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,018
You know, it occurs to me

401
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,220
that once you've accepted
my offer of an apprenticeship,

402
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:04,889
you should probably
start taking notes.

403
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:09,027
I'm not becoming
your apprentice.

404
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,863
No, of course not.
Not in an official capacity.

405
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:13,564
More likely
you'll peddle some fiction

406
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:16,734
to my father about me not
being ready to be alone yet.

407
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,753
Hmm? Whatever your
pride dictates,

408
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:22,256
I shan't hold it against you.

409
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:24,676
You know I'm not staying, right?

410
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:28,913
What? And continue
your journey to profound

411
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:30,598
professional satisfaction?

412
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,250
Why would you?

413
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,922
What are you doing?

414
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:42,259
Secret compartments have been
a part of cabinet-making

415
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,529
since the Age of Enlightenment.

416
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,648
You know, I once spent
a thrilling afternoon

417
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,816
examining
a Queen Anne secretary

418
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:51,119
with no fewer
than 25 hidden caches.

419
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:04,248
What is it?

420
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,418
Well, it's a compact,
but it's...

421
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,004
it's a very heavy compact.

422
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,307
It's not even Teri's shade.

423
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,093
She's much more of a winter.

424
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:16,511
Hmm.

425
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,468
See here...

426
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,438
wireless connector.

427
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,473
And with this,
Teri could

428
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:33,811
sign in to an entirely
private network.

429
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:41,169
WATSON:
Hidden cameras.

430
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:43,705
Nine hidden cameras.

431
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:45,873
Well, I think I've worked out

432
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,258
how Teri was profiting

433
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,993
from her arrangement
with the hookers.

434
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:50,928
(elevator bell dings)
Blackmail.

435
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,964
It would explain why Teri
allowed the prostitutes

436
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:56,467
to work at her hotel, but never
took a cut of the money, hmm?

437
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,335
She gave them access,
arranged their dates.

438
00:17:58,337 --> 00:17:59,887
They gave her
the opportunity

439
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,056
to capture guests on film
in flagrante delicto.

440
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:04,225
Well, if you're right,
that means every guest

441
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:06,894
she ever blackmailed is a
potential suspect in her murder.

442
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:08,512
Correct.

443
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:11,182
You said you found a couple
of thousand hours of footage?

444
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:12,867
The cameras ran 24/7.

445
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:14,518
Unfortunately, there
are no time stamps

446
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,020
or references
on the videos.

447
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,522
Which means, it'll
probably take forever

448
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,208
to identify the guests
who performed

449
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,211
blackmail-worthy
acts on tape.

450
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:24,695
I'm gonna need teams

451
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:27,381
working on shifts to
get through it all.

452
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:28,966
It's gonna take days.

453
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,919
Not necessarily.

454
00:18:49,154 --> 00:18:51,522
Do I even want to know

455
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:53,024
what happened?

456
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,525
You haven't missed a thing.

457
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,444
More yak than shack so far.

458
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,730
Curiously, many of these videos

459
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:01,449
are entirely prostitute-free.

460
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:02,917
I meant the garbage.

461
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,401
Borrowed our neighbor's bin

462
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,403
to test your theory
about physical mess

463
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:07,905
and its correlation to relapse.

464
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:09,573
I've been sitting here
for hours,

465
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,408
and I haven't felt
any additional temptation

466
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,760
to use drugs.

467
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,762
We'll see how I am
in the morning.

468
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:17,465
(phone ringing)

469
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,300
(sighs)

470
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,024
Hello?

471
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:28,643
CARLY:
Is-is this Miss Watson?

472
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,094
Yes.

473
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:32,363
Hi. It's, um...
it's Carly Purcell.

474
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:34,782
You-you gave me your number
the other day.

475
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,617
Yes.

476
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,769
I'm glad you called.

477
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:40,321
Is everything okay?

478
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:41,939
Yeah-- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:43,825
I haven't taken any pills
or anything.

480
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:46,227
I just...

481
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:49,497
I-I just needed
to talk to someone.

482
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,448
Okay. Well, I'm here.

483
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,251
You sound upset.

484
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:56,003
You know what?
I-I don't even know you.

485
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,405
This was stupid. I-I...

486
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:59,056
No. I told you to call me

487
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,559
if you wanted to talk,
and you... and you called.

488
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,027
Just...

489
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:05,897
My-my mom.

490
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,632
I don't know.
The way she was.

491
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:12,270
She... she's not...
she's not what people thought.

492
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:13,804
What do you mean?

493
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:19,310
Carly, tell me where you are,
and I will come and meet you.

494
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,530
I'm really sorry,

495
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:24,115
but I... I've got to go.

496
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:26,667
(line clicks)

497
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:31,672
Hey.

498
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:34,342
I thought you'd still be looking
at that secret camera video.

499
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:36,210
I finished an hour ago.

500
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,012
But it turns out,
the photographs

501
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:39,881
hidden in Mrs. Purcell's
computer

502
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:41,465
are far more interesting.

503
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,217
So, Teri had
dirty pictures, too?

504
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,102
Uh-uh.

505
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,194
Wait. It gets better.

506
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:55,496
I know what you're thinking.

507
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:57,681
Innocuous. Mundane.

508
00:20:57,683 --> 00:20:59,483
But each of these
stultifying images

509
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,203
contains almost
a gig of memory.

510
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:03,687
That's enormous.

511
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,456
Mm. That's steganography,

512
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,242
the science of embedding
hidden messages in plain sight,

513
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:10,428
security through obscurity.

514
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,047
So, you're saying that Teri's
picture files are so large

515
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:14,865
because she has content
hidden in them.

516
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,834
Mm. Luckily, I have
a decryption program

517
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:21,005
that should unlock
the coded data

518
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,757
in a matter of minutes.

519
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:25,760
Carly called me

520
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,345
last night.

521
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:28,712
I didn't mention it

522
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:30,714
because she confided in me
the other day.

523
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:32,266
About her drug use?

524
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:34,902
I overheard a snippet
of conversation

525
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,021
while I was questioning
her father.

526
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,406
It didn't seem relevant.

527
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:39,941
Has it become relevant?

528
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:41,525
Well, she did mention something
about her mother

529
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,060
not being the person
that everyone thought

530
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:44,445
she was.

531
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:45,830
I must warn you, Watson.

532
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:47,248
Whatever's on these videos
is likely

533
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,534
to be the vilest
and most startling material

534
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:52,003
that Mrs. Purcell
gathered,

535
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:54,622
so you might not
want to watch this.

536
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,759
Okay.

537
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:01,212
(men speaking Farsi)

538
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:03,247
(man speaking French)

539
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,483
Wow. Yeah, I don't know how

540
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:07,618
I'm ever going
to unsee any of that.

541
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,053
Shh.

542
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:11,439
(men speaking French, Farsi)

543
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:20,931
What? What, who
are you calling?

544
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,483
Captain Gregson.

545
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:25,286
We need to go back to the
Purcell home immediately.

546
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,938
Why? Because some French guy
is putting on too much deodorant?

547
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,041
It's not what the people
in these videos are doing,

548
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:32,910
Watson, it's what
they're saying.

549
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:35,279
(sirens approaching)

550
00:22:37,782 --> 00:22:38,966
(siren blaring)

551
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:40,935
(tires screeching)

552
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:45,639
(indistinct radio transmission)

553
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,308
You're quite good,
you know that?

554
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,677
You really had me
going the other day.

555
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,678
Beg your pardon?

556
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,229
Your accent,
your attire,

557
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:54,631
your décor-- it all virtually
screams "average American."

558
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,684
Except you're
neither, are you?

559
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:59,687
Someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on here?

560
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,772
Yeah, you're a... a spy.

561
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:03,640
So was your late wife.

562
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,159
What?

563
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:07,278
We have a warrant to search
your home, Mr. Purcell.

564
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,612
OLIVER:
Based on what?

565
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:10,114
GREGSON:
Based on your secret videos

566
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,649
that your wife made with
her "globally relevant" guests.

567
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:14,985
HOLMES: At first I thought
she was using them

568
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,820
as blackmail--
why else would she

569
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,123
facilitate a prostitution
ring in her own hotel

570
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,175
and collect
none of the profits?

571
00:23:21,177 --> 00:23:22,510
Now I have the answer.

572
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:24,495
The escorts made
the hotel popular

573
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:26,497
amongst international
power brokers,

574
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:28,849
foreign businessmen,
diplomats visiting

575
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,051
the nearby UN--

576
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,835
only it wasn't
their bad behavior

577
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:33,554
that Teri wanted
caught on tape,

578
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:35,022
it was their
information.

579
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:36,524
I imagine that
while she was

580
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:38,342
collecting intelligence
from her place of business,

581
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:41,028
you were doing the same
at your financial consulting firm?

582
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,315
I was fired months ago.
No. You resigned.

583
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:47,368
Your firm recently signed a contract
with the Department of Defense.

584
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,070
GREGSON: The DoD would have
required a thorough

585
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:51,072
background check on everyone
that worked at the company.

586
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:53,023
You knew your legend
wouldn't hold up

587
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,525
to that level of scrutiny.

588
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,127
"Legend"?

589
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:57,861
The elaborate
and utterly false identities

590
00:23:57,863 --> 00:23:59,497
provided by your
Russian spymasters

591
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,999
for you and your wife
to pass as American citizens.

592
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,535
Oh, so now I'm not only a spy,
I'm a Russian spy?

593
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:06,370
You made a point
of stepping out

594
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:07,721
<i>to shake hands the other day.</i>

595
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:09,323
<i>It's bad form</i>
<i>in Russian culture</i>

596
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,674
to shake hands
beneath the arch

597
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:12,676
of a doorway, is it not?
Then there were

598
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:15,045
the coins that your wife left
lying around in her office.

599
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,698
<i>In Russian folklore,</i>
<i>money goes to money.</i>

600
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,958
Leaving coins out is
a way of inviting good

601
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:21,073
fortune into your life.

602
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,055
Didn't quite work out for her,
though, did it?

603
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,223
Listen to me.

604
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,525
If what happened to Teri

605
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,226
had anything to do
with her spying,

606
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:32,079
<i>now</i> would be
the time to tell us.

607
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:35,749
I want a lawyer.

608
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:38,919
Yeah, I would expect
that you would.

609
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,069
Just got off the phone
with the Feds.

610
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,904
They're on their way down.

611
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:53,105
Can I question
Oliver now?

612
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:55,340
GREGSON:
This is a joint investigation.

613
00:24:55,342 --> 00:24:59,244
NYPD handles the homicide;
FBI handles the espionage.

614
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:01,580
The homicide and the espionage
are the same thing.

615
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:04,750
We wait. As it is, we're lucky
they're letting us sit in.

616
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:07,336
Oh, yeah, by all means,
let's express our gratitude

617
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,787
to the lurching,
inept bureaucracy

618
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:11,390
that is preventing us
from questioning a suspect

619
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:13,425
who sits not
ten feet away!

620
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:14,793
Oh, good, you're here.

621
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:17,596
He's doing
his tantrum thing.

622
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:19,848
WATSON: I've been trying
to get ahold of Carly

623
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,517
since I heard you
picked up her father.

624
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,435
Has anyone heard from her?
Well, she wasn't home

625
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:25,470
when we went
to pick up Oliver,

626
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:27,022
so we left a uniform
at the house.

627
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,907
She's 17 years old
and she's in crisis.

628
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:31,076
Her mother was just murdered,
and she's about to find out

629
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:32,494
that both her parents
are Russian spies.

630
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:33,612
We need to find her.

631
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:35,497
She's right.
Carly could be

632
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:38,117
in danger, especially if she
was part of her parents' operation.

633
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,536
I talked to this girl--
she is a confused teenager,

634
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,703
not a sleeper agent.

635
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,172
And now she's alone.

636
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:47,176
Spies are never alone.

637
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,627
They have handlers.

638
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:50,662
SILVER:
<i>And I know you probably have</i>

639
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:52,681
some figure in the back
of your mind for how much...

640
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,550
I was wrong about you, Geoffrey.

641
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,669
What?! We're in a meeting here.

642
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:59,138
Ladies and gentlemen,
kudos to you

643
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,939
for your attraction
to such a worthy cause.

644
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:02,608
The fact that
I'm about to demonstrate

645
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,643
that Mr. Silver is
actually a Russian spy

646
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:06,678
should by no means
discourage you from giving,

647
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,280
and giving generously.

648
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:10,616
I don't know what the hell
you are talking about,

649
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,818
but all three of you
need to leave.

650
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,486
You provided Oliver
and Teri Purcell

651
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:16,121
with cash, cover,
resources,

652
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:18,490
ferried their stolen secrets
back to Mother Russia,

653
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:21,126
all under the guise of your
international charity work.

654
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,328
Quite a brilliant cover,
actually.

655
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,025
That is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

656
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,501
Is it? Well, we know that
Teri Purcell was working as a spy,

657
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:30,219
and she was passing
video recordings

658
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,370
hidden behind mundane photographs
via steganography.

659
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:34,024
It just so happens one
of those photographs was

660
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:35,809
open on your desktop

661
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,676
two days ago.
Do you mind if I pull it up

662
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,728
so I can show Detective Bell?
Yes. Abso...

663
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,379
No, I do; I do mind.

664
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,981
Would you get him
out of here?

665
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:44,733
I'm quite happy
to leave by myself, actually.

666
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,902
Just tell me everything you know
about who killed Teri Purcell.

667
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:49,104
Oh, my God, I don't
know who killed Teri.

668
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:50,889
Now, if looking
in my computer

669
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:53,391
is gonna get you to leave,
then fine, go ahead.

670
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:54,993
Thank you.

671
00:26:56,562 --> 00:27:00,115
(Holmes typing)

672
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:06,071
It's no longer there.

673
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:07,923
Obviously, someone

674
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:09,791
just scrubbed it clean.

675
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:13,078
If you're convinced
that I'm a spy...

676
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,930
arrest me.

677
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:17,182
Otherwise,
you got to go.

678
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:19,051
(phone ringing)

679
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:21,386
HOLMES (over phone): Captain Gregson,
how may I be of assistance?

680
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:24,256
Oliver Purcell's agreed
to talk to us and the FBI.

681
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:27,359
I told the Feds we wouldn't
have found the guy without you.

682
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:30,229
They said you could
sit in, all right?

683
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:34,599
Our handlers thought we'd
work well together as a couple.

684
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,201
Not because
we were in love.

685
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:37,452
Our relationship

686
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:39,437
was never romantic, it was...

687
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,707
a patriotic transaction.

688
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:43,792
But Carly <i>is</i>
your biological daughter,

689
00:27:43,794 --> 00:27:45,277
(over speaker):
correct?

690
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,280
OLIVER: That was two operatives
obeying orders.

691
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:52,301
We started having sex when
we were urged to conceive.

692
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,487
Stopped when
Teri got pregnant.

693
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:57,756
Once we had Carly, we...

694
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:00,292
looked more like
a real American family.

695
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,460
But...

696
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:05,063
you can't raise a spy.

697
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,518
Teri and I found ourselves
with a daughter.

698
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,070
I may not have loved Teri,

699
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:14,973
but we both loved Carly.

700
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:17,809
When did you initiate her
into the family business?

701
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:20,412
Come on, Mr. Purcell,

702
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:22,614
the Russians invested
a great deal of time and money

703
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:24,316
into your family--
they must have had

704
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:27,286
a plan for Carly.
They did.

705
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,038
But I worked 20 years
for the SVR,

706
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,341
living a lie.

707
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,160
I wanted more for my daughter.

708
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:36,745
WOMAN:
You and your wife

709
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:39,047
see eye to eye on that?
No.

710
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,383
Teri wanted
to tell Carly.

711
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:45,137
To Teri, serving Russia
was still the highest calling.

712
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,773
That's got to be a hard
disagreement to resolve.

713
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:50,175
It was.

714
00:28:50,177 --> 00:28:53,645
And so I... threatened
to expose the operation.

715
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:56,648
Said I'd take my chances
with the U.S. Government

716
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,284
before I let the SVR
use my daughter.

717
00:28:59,286 --> 00:29:01,987
That was enough
to shut Teri and Geoffrey up.

718
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:04,906
Geoffrey Silver,
your handler?

719
00:29:04,908 --> 00:29:06,375
HOLMES:
Hm.

720
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:09,244
I believe that
constitutes a positive I.D.

721
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:12,247
on Mr. Silver's
involvement in espionage.

722
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:16,134
OLIVER: Look, I don't know
who killed Teri, (phone vibrating)

723
00:29:16,136 --> 00:29:18,220
but I'll plead guilty
to the rest of it,

724
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,005
tell you everything I know,

725
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:22,474
but only if you
leave Carly alone.

726
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:25,210
She's innocent.

727
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:30,399
Put that in writing,
and I'm yours.

728
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,100
Hey, Carly.

729
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,902
Are you okay?

730
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,320
I was coming home last night

731
00:29:35,322 --> 00:29:37,406
when I saw the police
taking my dad away.

732
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,941
What's going on, Ms. Watson?

733
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:43,328
He's just answering
some questions right now.

734
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,530
D-Do they think he had
something to do with my mom?

735
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:46,564
'Cause he didn't!

736
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,533
Okay, tell me where you are,

737
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:51,837
and I'll come
and meet you, all right?

738
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,622
CARLY:
Thanks for meeting me.

739
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:56,058
It's been a rough couple
of days, you know?

740
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,760
Of course. I get it.

741
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:00,262
(sniffles)

742
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:02,080
Carly, you said
the other night

743
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:04,716
that your mom wasn't who
everyone thought she was.

744
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:08,086
Did you know
she was a spy?

745
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:13,809
And your father, too?

746
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:18,613
How long have
you known for?

747
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:22,534
(crying): My mom told me
a few days ago.

748
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:26,738
That's a lot
for anyone to process.

749
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,042
My father shouldn't be
under arrest-- it's my fault.

750
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:31,276
You can't take on
your parents' mistakes.

751
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:33,279
You don't understand.

752
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,114
I'm the one who's responsible.

753
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:38,717
I killed my mother.

754
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:49,595
I, um, I got
my letter of acceptance

755
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,980
from Michigan that day.

756
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,432
Full athletic scholarship.

757
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:56,913
The first thing I do
is call my mom,

758
00:30:56,915 --> 00:31:00,850
'cause I figured she'd be
as thrilled as I was.

759
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:04,771
(Carly sobs)

760
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,256
It's okay, Carly.

761
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:09,308
Just try to tell us
what happened.

762
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,761
She just...
she sounded weird.

763
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:15,848
She told me that I had to go
straight to the hotel, and so I did.

764
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,184
And when I got there,
she told me that Michigan

765
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:20,469
was out of the question,
that I was going to Georgetown,

766
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:24,607
and... and I didn't understand
why she was being so insistent.

767
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:26,943
But then she
explained why.

768
00:31:26,945 --> 00:31:29,996
She told you the truth about...
her and your father?

769
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:32,699
CARLY: <i>At first, I thought</i>
<i>it was a joke.</i>

770
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,250
Like, Russian spies?

771
00:31:34,252 --> 00:31:37,170
We-we live in Westchester.
We have a minivan.

772
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,425
But it wasn't a joke.

773
00:31:42,427 --> 00:31:45,628
Every-Everything my parents
had told me was a lie.

774
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,998
Odd that your father
wasn't there, as well, no?

775
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,017
She told me that we had to
keep it between the two of us.

776
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:54,036
<i>That he wouldn't understand,</i>
<i>and so,</i>

777
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,972
it was really important
for all of us

778
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:58,641
for me to do
exactly what she told me to do.

779
00:31:58,643 --> 00:32:01,677
Did she threaten you?

780
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,614
She told me there were people
out there who could hurt us.

781
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:07,516
And I figured that they were
the people she was working for.

782
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:09,351
GREGSON:
Why was your mom

783
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:11,237
so intent on you going
to Georgetown?

784
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:14,040
She said they have
the better government program.

785
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,691
She said that a degree

786
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:17,744
from there would
really mean something.

787
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:19,245
I guess, after college,

788
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:21,047
I was supposed to get a job
in Washington, or...

789
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:24,550
Where you could operate
as a second generation agent.

790
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:25,835
U.S. national

791
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,253
who could penetrate
the corridors

792
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:28,721
of government power

793
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:31,040
and gain access
to information she never could.

794
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:33,726
She had my whole life
planned out.

795
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:36,429
She wanted me to give up
everything I ever wanted

796
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:39,048
for a country I'd never
even seen, so I said, "No."

797
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,217
I said no to Georgetown,
no to spying.

798
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:43,986
I was going to Michigan,
I was going to play soccer.

799
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:48,241
(crying):
I just... I...

800
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:51,944
I'd fought back from too much
not to follow my dream.

801
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:53,696
I-I told her

802
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:55,698
that I'd go to the police
if she tried to stop me.

803
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,033
I told her that-that

804
00:32:57,035 --> 00:33:00,086
I'd tell them
about her.

805
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:05,541
But then, as I was leaving...

806
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:09,095
she grabbed me, and...

807
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:10,713
I-I don't know.
I was just...

808
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:13,015
I was so freaked out that...

809
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:15,251
I-I guess I just...
I guess I just

810
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:17,136
<i>shoved her.</i>

811
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:19,555
I called her name
a couple of times,

812
00:33:19,557 --> 00:33:22,058
but she just lay there. She...

813
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,593
That's-that's when
Mr. Silver came in.

814
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:26,562
Geoffrey Silver?

815
00:33:26,564 --> 00:33:28,831
He told me that he was
my mom's handler

816
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,367
and that-th-that

817
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:32,768
<i>I was in a lot of trouble.</i>

818
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,153
He told me that...

819
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:35,938
if I didn't go right away

820
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,941
I was gonna go to jail and I was
never gonna see my dad again.

821
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:43,162
I-I was... I
was so afraid, I...

822
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:46,165
My dad was all I had left,
and I just...

823
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:49,836
I didn't know what to do,
so I went home and...

824
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:53,055
I didn't say anything.

825
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:56,292
Whatever-whatever else

826
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:57,844
you think my dad did,

827
00:33:57,846 --> 00:33:59,645
he didn't kill my mom.

828
00:34:01,598 --> 00:34:03,799
I did.

829
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,521
SILVER:
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

830
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:12,641
But I can neither confirm
nor deny anything

831
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:14,243
Carly Purcell may have told you.

832
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:15,661
GREGSON:
'Cause you don't

833
00:34:15,663 --> 00:34:17,313
want to be charged as
an accessory to murder?

834
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:19,582
And because I don't
recognize your authority.

835
00:34:19,584 --> 00:34:22,835
Finished playing the part
of the American citizen, I see.

836
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:26,488
You know you're going
to jail either way, right?

837
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:31,210
Oliver Purcell's given the FBI
enough to put you away

838
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:33,662
for the rest
of your natural life.

839
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:36,382
Did I say something
funny to you?

840
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:43,973
I'd be very surprised
if I spent more than a week

841
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:45,441
in one of your jails.

842
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,362
People in my alleged
line of work

843
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:51,147
don't tend to be locked up.

844
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:53,349
We tend to be traded.

845
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,904
The U.S. government
is probably

846
00:34:57,906 --> 00:35:00,239
perusing a catalogue
of political prisoners

847
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:02,191
they'd like
released from Russia,

848
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:04,360
as we speak.

849
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:07,029
GREGSON:
Well, then.

850
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:10,366
I guess we'll just
let the Feds do

851
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:12,919
whatever it is the Feds do.

852
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:15,371
Come on.

853
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:21,594
You ruined
that girl's life.

854
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,521
HOLMES: I must say, Watson,
I'm quite flattered.

855
00:35:32,523 --> 00:35:35,524
It's a lovely homage
to my methodology.

856
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:38,560
But why apply it to a case
that's already solved?

857
00:35:38,562 --> 00:35:40,496
That door was closed.

858
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:41,664
Was it?

859
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,699
Look, I just...
(sighs)

860
00:35:43,701 --> 00:35:45,668
Carly Purcell didn't deserve
what's happened to her.

861
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,204
I just thought if I looked at
the evidence one more time...

862
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:49,372
I don't know.

863
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:51,424
You could what?
Rewrite history?

864
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:52,908
She already
confessed.

865
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,743
What is that?

866
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:56,745
Spaghetti in a mug?

867
00:35:56,747 --> 00:36:01,767
I take it that, uh, there's
still no clean bowls or plates?

868
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:03,752
(sighs)

869
00:36:05,255 --> 00:36:07,139
How do you deal with...

870
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,892
cases not working out
the way you want them to?

871
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:12,395
The only promise a puzzle
makes is an answer.

872
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:14,780
Liking the answer
doesn't factor in.

873
00:36:14,782 --> 00:36:16,782
In our line of work it mustn't.

874
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:19,268
You're right.

875
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,270
What is that?

876
00:36:21,272 --> 00:36:24,106
Oh, uh, Teri Purcell's
autopsy report

877
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:26,075
just showed up
on our front doorstep.

878
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:29,495
Oh, I actually requested
that from Gregson's office.

879
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:31,664
(sighs)

880
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:40,006
There's a break

881
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:42,358
in the fourth metacarpal.

882
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,626
That is a... boxer's fracture.

883
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:47,796
Resulting from a clenched fist
striking something or...

884
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:49,148
someone.

885
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,217
WATSON:
You don't think that...

886
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:53,769
that Teri fought back
against Carly, do you?

887
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:56,439
She just willingly confessed
to matricide this afternoon.

888
00:36:56,441 --> 00:37:00,409
I doubt she would leave out the
part where her mum fought back.

889
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:05,031
The pen.

890
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:07,416
Yeah.

891
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:13,923
HOLMES:
Mr. Silver.

892
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:17,676
Such a pleasure
to see you again.

893
00:37:17,678 --> 00:37:19,562
You're angry.

894
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:20,930
You know
the government's working

895
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:22,598
on one of those deals
you mentioned,

896
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,884
looking to trade you back
to where you came from.

897
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:29,171
I'm afraid I'm about to bollocks
that all up for you now.

898
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:32,992
That would be...
impressive.

899
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:34,310
GREGSON:
For the record, Mr. Silver,

900
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:36,112
you never saw Teri,

901
00:37:36,114 --> 00:37:38,680
you never visited her at the
hotel the night of her murder?

902
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:42,851
As I explained to your men
the day I met them,

903
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:47,156
I didn't see her for
the entire week before she died.

904
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,858
<i>Nyet,</i> comrade. Big lie.

905
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,678
You saw her the
day she died.

906
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,081
You came running into her
office when you realized

907
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,033
her meeting with her
daughter had gone south.

908
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:00,719
You then pressured Carly into
joining the family business,

909
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,304
and you asked her to leave

910
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:04,540
so you could dispose
of her mother's body.

911
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:06,425
<i>The only problem was,</i>

912
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:09,095
she wasn't dead yet.

913
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:11,880
You had a big decision to make.

914
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,849
You'd just used
her apparent murder

915
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:17,319
to leverage her daughter
into becoming a spy.

916
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:20,739
Carly was quite
an asset for you.

917
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:22,908
A real U.S. citizen.

918
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,061
Not much use in the short term,
but in the long term--

919
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:27,663
sky's the limit.

920
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:29,365
I mean, she-she could be

921
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:32,001
President Purcell
when all was said and done.

922
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:36,672
Unfortunately, the same could
not be said for poor Teri.

923
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:38,740
<i>So you decided to...</i>

924
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:40,409
retire her.

925
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:41,994
WATSON: Teri fought
back, though.

926
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:43,829
She hit you hard enough
to break her hand.

927
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:45,965
When that didn't work,
she relieved you of that.

928
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:50,085
Used it to
stab at you.

929
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:52,805
She only managed
to break it open in her hand.

930
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:54,490
Nonsense.

931
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:55,941
HOLMES:
Yeah.

932
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:57,676
I can understand
why it looks that way, yeah.

933
00:38:57,678 --> 00:39:00,196
After all, there was no ink
found at the crime scene.

934
00:39:00,198 --> 00:39:03,699
None on Teri, none on any of
the other linens in the washer.

935
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:06,902
But then I thought, just because
you can't see a stain

936
00:39:06,904 --> 00:39:09,271
doesn't mean it isn't there.

937
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:12,575
Are you familiar with
the concept of invisible ink?

938
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:15,544
(laughing):
Invisible ink?

939
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,880
(laughs)
Yeah. Yeah, trust me.

940
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:21,116
I know precisely
how ridiculous it sounds.

941
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:23,836
Might as well have a phone
in your shoe.

942
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:25,787
And yet, spies like you

943
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:28,257
have been using
it for centuries.

944
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,143
This pen, for example,
had traces of a type known

945
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,062
as permanent fluorescing ink,

946
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:34,796
imperceptible to
the human eye,

947
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:36,482
and revealed only under

948
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:38,100
an ultraviolet light.

949
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:40,653
Now, I went to the morgue
this morning,

950
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:44,690
and I shone Teri's hand
under a UV lamp.

951
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:50,162
Even after the wash, her palm
was covered in the stuff.

952
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:52,031
And when she struggled with you,

953
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:54,867
she got it all
over your clothes.

954
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:58,337
Captain, if you will?

955
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,172
Exhibit B.

956
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,876
Your Zegna shirt,

957
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:05,327
raided from your closet

958
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:07,880
earlier today,
under a warrant.

959
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:11,267
When I shine a UV lamp on it,

960
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:15,354
the story it reveals
is as clear as it is compelling.

961
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:21,694
And that's Teri's handprint
on your shirt.

962
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:24,029
You didn't just

963
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:26,282
see her the other night,

964
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:28,234
you killed her.

965
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:31,453
You were right
the other day.

966
00:40:31,455 --> 00:40:33,622
The U.S.

967
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:36,875
would trade a spy
under the right circumstances.

968
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:40,329
These, however,
are not those circumstances.

969
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:42,998
A matter of fact,

970
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,585
I see your stay
in the States being extended.

971
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:51,206
Somewhere along the lines
of 20 to life?

972
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,428
What's going to happen
with my dad?

973
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,980
He's cooperating

974
00:40:57,982 --> 00:41:00,649
with the FBI right now,
in exchange for immunity.

975
00:41:00,651 --> 00:41:02,551
You'll both be placed
in Witness Protection

976
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:04,069
and get a new start.

977
00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:08,691
(sniffling):
I, uh...

978
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:12,578
I know my mom was asking me
to do something really terrible,

979
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,897
but I loved her, and I just,

980
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:20,119
I still feel really,
really responsible.

981
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:22,254
It's going to hurt for a while.

982
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:24,906
You need to let it.

983
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:28,010
And if any old
demons come back...

984
00:41:28,012 --> 00:41:29,712
I'll-I'll-I'll call you.

985
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:32,298
Or I'll...
I'll talk to my dad.

986
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,433
I promise.

987
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:36,084
BELL:
Hey.

988
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:37,553
Listen, if you two
are through,

989
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:39,488
I can take Miss Purcell
to see her dad now.

990
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,807
Great.

991
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:44,026
Thank you.

992
00:41:50,483 --> 00:41:52,951
Tough times don't last.

993
00:41:52,953 --> 00:41:56,038
Tough people do.

994
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:09,918
How's Miss Purcell?

995
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,171
As well as can be expected.

996
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:14,340
Quite proud of you,
Watson--

997
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:15,724
your doggedness.

998
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:17,009
I give you as much credit

999
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:19,478
for solving this case
as I do myself.

1000
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,264
Thanks.

1001
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:24,800
Hm. No wonder you're so keen
to stay on as my associate.

1002
00:42:24,802 --> 00:42:25,984
Sherlock...

1003
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:27,603
As I proposed the other day,

1004
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,855
we can tell my father
I've hit a bit of a rough patch.

1005
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:30,989
He'll keep the checks coming.

1006
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:32,274
You can continue
to hone your skill.

1007
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:34,493
I took another
job this morning.

1008
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:38,414
I work with other therapists,

1009
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:39,948
and I was referred
to another client,

1010
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,700
so I'll be starting
with him next week,

1011
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,202
after you and I wrap up.

1012
00:42:43,204 --> 00:42:45,254
I see.

1013
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:50,175
I'm usually quite good
with deductions.

1014
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:51,810
Are you okay?

1015
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,553
My dear Watson,
whenever am I not?
