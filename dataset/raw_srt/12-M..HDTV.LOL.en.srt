1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,449
Here's Owens, the Welshman.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,118
Nice piece of skill
to get past Neep.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,120
Still Owens, heading toward
the penalty area.

4
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:10,655
Wide it goes to Marwick.

5
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:12,623
Marwick with it.
Touch inside to Williams.

6
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,342
Williams with a lovely chip
toward the back post.

7
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:16,627
Mountroy is there.
It's in the net!

8
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:18,129
A scorching header
from Mountroy,

9
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:19,797
and Manchester United
are back on top!

10
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,248
It's 2-1 here as Arsenal
again caught ball-watching

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,416
in the defensive end.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,568
No. No.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,070
No! No!

14
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:48,576
No. No! No!

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,421
No!

16
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,974
No!

17
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,409
What are bees doing in here?

18
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:23,945
Buzzing.
No. I mean,

19
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:26,247
why aren't they on the
roof with the others?

20
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:28,332
I'm seeing how the indoor
temperature suits them.

21
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:31,953
Our six weeks together
are very nearly up, Watson.

22
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:34,589
In a matter of days,
your room will be vacant.

23
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,173
I'm very seriously
considering

24
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,259
turning it into
one large apiary.

25
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:40,761
Finally the space
will serve a purpose.

26
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:42,329
Oh, you say
the nicest things.

27
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:46,384
The end of our companionship
is actually what I wanted

28
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,219
to talk to you about.
Do tell.

29
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,104
Well, when I'm wrapping up
with a client,

30
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:51,889
I like to carry out
exit protocols.

31
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:52,923
Sounds ominous.

32
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:54,843
No, we just need
to carve out a time to talk.

33
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:56,227
It's time I told
you, Watson.

34
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,895
You place far too much
emphasis on talking.

35
00:01:57,897 --> 00:02:00,481
Most of what we humans have
to say to one another is

36
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:01,949
communicated haptically.

37
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,118
When I think
of the many thousands of words

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,287
that you yourself have wasted
during your time here...

39
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,789
We'll go to dinner, we'll talk--
verbally, haptically, whatever.

40
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,459
I think the whole point is
to reflect on your progress.

41
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,661
Reflection is for mirrors. Can't
you just hand me a report card?

42
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,696
Well, I am working
on a final assessment,

43
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:17,632
but that is for your father.

44
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,967
Right, 'cause he's the one
paying your exorbitant fees.

45
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,003
Actually, my fees are
the opposite of exorbitant.

46
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,504
He'll probably put it
on his fridge

47
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,306
with his many colorful magnets.

48
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:27,675
Oh, no, wait. He doesn't have
any magnets or interest in me.

49
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:33,514
Captain Gregson, how
may I be of assistance?

50
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:37,234
The owner of the house is a CPA
by the name of Ian Vickers.

51
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:40,554
We're pretty sure
he's also the victim.

52
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,740
And by "pretty sure,"
you mean...

53
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:46,027
I mean there's no body.

54
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:48,329
Just blood.

55
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,064
This is all
from one person?

56
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,067
Well, we pulled some hairs
out of a comb in his bathroom

57
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,003
to check the DNA,
so, yeah, for now.

58
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:59,590
Vickers' secretary
dropped off some files,

59
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,042
and found the place
like this.

60
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:05,596
Hard to like his chances,
given all this.

61
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,432
Hey. You okay?

62
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,718
So, aside

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,553
from the blood,
the scene is clean.

64
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:15,272
No footprints, no witnesses,
no nothing.

65
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:18,109
Whoever did this-- we don't
know the first thing about him.

66
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:19,360
He's tall.

67
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:20,778
I beg your pardon?

68
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,930
He's tall. Strong, too.

69
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,066
He'd have to be
to hang his victims from a hook.

70
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:27,535
Hook's gone now, but it
was at one point attached

71
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,787
to a tripod device of
the killer's own design.

72
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,605
He assembled it
after he incapacitated Vickers,

73
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,774
then hung him upside down,
slit his throat.

74
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:35,326
Gravity and the last few
beats of his heart drove

75
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:36,861
every last ounce of blood
from his body.

76
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,262
A tripod device?

77
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,048
Here. It's from
one of its legs.

78
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,717
There are two
more groove marks

79
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,670
inside the perimeter of the
blood-- there and there.

80
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:48,389
After he'd completely
drained Vickers,

81
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,424
he dismantled the
device, taking it

82
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:53,094
and the exsanguinated corpse
of his victim with him.

83
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,763
How the hell did you deduce all
that from this pool of blood?

84
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:58,599
I didn't deduce anything,
actually.

85
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:02,153
I've stalked
this particular madman before.

86
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:05,039

M.

91
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,937
A simple moniker
for a complicated monster.

92
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,957
He is, without question,
the most sinister taker of lives

93
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,842
I have ever had the displeasure
of pursuing.

94
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,779
He's been active
since January 2002.

95
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:39,980
During the last ten years,

96
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:42,816
he has tallied a body count
of 37.

97
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:44,985
His image has never
been captured.

98
00:04:44,987 --> 00:04:46,286
He is methodical.

99
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:48,572
He is as efficient
as he is clean.

100
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:51,158
And he also has no type
or victim profile,

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,793
which makes it almost impossible

102
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:55,746
to predict when, where,
or whom he might strike.

103
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:58,298
His oldest victim in the
U.K. was in her late 80s.

104
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,801
The youngest-- 12.

105
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:03,203
He drains his victims
of his or her blood,

106
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,921
then dumps their bodies
in the ocean.

107
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:07,224
Bodies of 21 of his
victims were recovered

108
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:09,226
when they washed up
on the coastline.

109
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,312
The other 16 were, presumably,
carried out to sea.

110
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:13,847
And I wouldn't be surprised

111
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:15,232
if the body of
his latest victim,

112
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:17,150
Mr. Vickers,
were to make an appearance

113
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,719
on one of your beaches
in the next few days.

114
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:21,154
I'm gonna call
the Coast Guard,

115
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,906
tell them to keep an eye out?
Yeah.

116
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,075
I trust that the lab
has by now confirmed

117
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:27,327
that the blood
at the scene was Vickers'?

118
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,829
All 12 pints of it.

119
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,330
M's fascination with blood is

120
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:33,366
as mysterious
as the man himself.

121
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:35,418
He mentions it in his, uh,

122
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,003
correspondence
with the police...

123
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,074
...but only rarely.
You'll notice that he has

124
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:42,175
a tendency to ramble.

125
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,794
Do not be fooled.

126
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:46,746
I have long suspected
that M isn't nearly as mad

127
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:48,265
as he would like us to believe.

128
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:51,184
His letters are, in my humble
estimation, a feint,

129
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:52,702
an attempt to make
the authorities, or anyone

130
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:54,521
who would attempt
to analyze him,

131
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,807
believe that he is one thing,
when he is, in fact, another.

132
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,275
Finally, M tends

133
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:00,927
to kill in bunches,
so the whole NYPD

134
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:02,979
should be prepared
for more bodies to drop.

135
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:04,231
I've brought my
own personal files

136
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,732
on M to the station,

137
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,767
and I'm arranging them
for your consumption.

138
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,405
Hey. How are
you doing?

139
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:13,940
Quite well. Why?

140
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,575
You seem oddly chipper.

141
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,910
I do?

142
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:18,578
Yeah, and last night,
at the crime scene--

143
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,463
the way you were
staring at the blood.

144
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:21,948
Well, I was struck,
I suppose.

145
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,134
I mean, the moment
I laid eyes on the scene,

146
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:28,054
I knew it could only be
the handiwork of... M.

147
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:29,306
And this morning?

148
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,095
Ten years ago,
when M first started killing,

149
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:37,764
I was an integral part
of the investigation.

150
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,884
By the time he had claimed
his 36th life, however,

151
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,786
my addiction was
out of control.

152
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,438
I was, I'm quite
embarrassed to say,

153
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,107
useless to the police.

154
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,859
Now, his appearance here
in the States--

155
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:50,410
it's a second chance for me.

156
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:52,779
It's an opportunity to do
what I should have done

157
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:55,282
a long time ago-- bring
a ruthless killer to justice.

158
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,917
Let me ask you something.

159
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,286
This-this M character--
what, uh...

160
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:02,205
What was his awareness
of you back in London?

161
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:04,991
Oh, he may have referenced me
in a letter or two. Why?

162
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:07,510
Seems sort of coincidental,
don't you think?

163
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,596
Him coming to New York
so soon after you?

164
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,515
Well, I-I...
I hadn't considered that.

165
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,667
Really?
I suppose

166
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:17,437
it is a little odd-- flattering
if you think about it.

167
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,505
Hmm. I'm gonna post
a couple uniforms

168
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,949
in front of your place
until further notice.

169
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,810
Captain, I hardly think that's necessary.
Much appreciated. Thank you.

170
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,197
Hey, just a reminder that
I have an appointment

171
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,450
in a little while, but I will
be back in a couple of hours.

172
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,369
I shall count the seconds
until your return.

173
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:35,355
Well, in the meantime, I thought
I could dig into the M files.

174
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:36,873
You have so many.
I can help.

175
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,491
Actually, Watson,
it occurs to me

176
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:40,827
that help from you is the
last thing that I need.

177
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:42,295
Much as it pains
me to admit it,

178
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,797
you have become
something of a crutch.

179
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,665
I need to get used to
working by myself again.

180
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,751
Are you sure?
Positive.

181
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:49,252
In fact, I encourage you

182
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:50,720
to leave for your
appointment immediately.

183
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,589
This is good. Exciting.

184
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,708
I shall keep you apprised
of my progress via e-mail.

185
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,561
So, it's been a while

186
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,397
since I've been here.

187
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,265
It's been really busy.

188
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,817
With?

189
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,603
Sherlock. It's our
last week together,

190
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:09,522
so I'm trying to
get us both ready.

191
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:13,393
I'm your therapist, Joan.

192
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:16,496
My confidentiality protects
your confidentiality.

193
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:20,233
How does he feel
about you leaving?

194
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:23,336
I think he's ready.

195
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:25,789
I mean, he told me
to take off early this morning

196
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,341
so that he could work
on his new case without me.

197
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:30,627
You must have mixed feelings.

198
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,514
I know how invigorating
you've found his work.

199
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:37,200
You went from being a surgeon
to an addiction counselor.

200
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,753
There's no reason you couldn't
make another change,

201
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:42,272
pursue work
of a more investigative nature.

202
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:45,558
Yeah-- I-I'm not interested

203
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,593
in becoming an investigator.

204
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,446
I like what I do right now.

205
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,481
Well, there's the rub,
I'm afraid.

206
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,817
Short of your client
falling off the wagon,

207
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,785
your "right now"

208
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:59,222
is coming to an end.

209
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,182
♪

210
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:36,910
Thanks for the effort.

211
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:39,696
Thanks, baby.

212
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,318
Neep.

213
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,953
So, what do you do?

214
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,588
He's got the ball,
but he's having to work hard

215
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,090
to keep hold of it.

216
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,292
Owens.

217
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,165
Before I go,

218
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,684
you want another go?

219
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,306
Do you mind, love?

220
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:09,442
The Arsenal are playing.

221
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,677
Here's Taylor.

222
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,863
Throw  here.

223
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,617
Thanks again, baby.

224
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,651
This was fun.

225
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,987
Now Owens.

226
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:22,739
Good challenge.

227
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,624
Well, he's letting
the play go here.

228
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:25,825
I never named a referee

229
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:28,578
who tries taking advantage.

230
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,046
Here's the shot!

231
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:33,199
So Arsenal get their corner.

232
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,675
Neep.

233
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:44,094
So dangerous!

234
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:45,595
Was brought here by Neep,

235
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:48,181
and that's really the way
to get the ball

236
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:50,733
out of the danger zone.

237
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,607
Hey. I got your text.

238
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:00,326
Meet Ian Vickers.

239
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,579
Washed up not long ago
on Roosevelt Island.

240
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:04,330
Thus narrowing
M's dump site

241
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:07,033
to the entire east
side of Manhattan.

242
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,287
My money's on
the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

243
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,039
Oil in the hair.

244
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,507
I noticed.
There's a high

245
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,544
concentration of industrial
engine oil around the navy yard.

246
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:21,097
I donated to the cleanup effort
a couple years ago.

247
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:31,107
I'm gonna miss this.

248
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,895
Well, maybe not
this, but...

249
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:37,763
this.

250
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,284
Working with you.

251
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,785
I think
what you do

252
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,654
is amazing.

253
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:46,739
I wanted to tell you that
at our "wrap-up dinner",

254
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:47,957
but it seems
less and less

255
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:49,542
likely that's gonna happen.

256
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:50,627
Anyway, I'm gonna

257
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:52,128
wait outside-- just give me

258
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,297
a five-minute warning,
and I'll call a cab.

259
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:05,958
So, given that it's after 11:00,
our delivery options

260
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,727
are a little more limited.

261
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,962
There is that
Vietnamese place on 23rd,

262
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:12,465
but I think you said it was
a front for songbird smuggling.

263
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,134
Watson, I need you
to be very, very quiet right now.

264
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:16,736
Why?

265
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:20,523
Because I believe our home
has just become a crime scene.

266
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,205
"Men make plans, God laughs.

267
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,003
"I am laughing at you
now, as I always have.

268
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:48,439
"You think you honor me
with your pursuit,

269
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,874
"you do not.

270
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,476
"You are a mouse
chasing a lion,

271
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:55,279
"a mere planet
in orbit

272
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:56,713
of a raging sun."

273
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,315
You talk to Ellis
and Hitch yet?

274
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,317
Yeah. They were parked
out front all night

275
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,385
and never saw anyone
come near the door.

276
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:03,820
He came in the back.

277
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,939
The lock on the rear door
was picked.

278
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:07,390
Quite expertly,
I might add.

279
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:08,859
I guess this answers
the question

280
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:11,227
about whether he came to
New York for you, huh?

281
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,829
My sincerest apologies, Captain.

282
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,065
If I'd have had any notion
that my presence here

283
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,900
would have drawn him to your city...
Hey,

284
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:20,020
hey, uh, he's the twist,
okay? Not you.

285
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:21,672
You two should go
pack a few things.

286
00:13:21,674 --> 00:13:23,440
I'm taking you
to a safe house

287
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,792
until all
this... M stuff

288
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:27,711
gets resolved.
Captain, I hardly think

289
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:29,379
that that's
necessary.

290
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,099
Wha...? There's a psychopath
with 37 notches

291
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:33,767
in his belt that
is targeting you

292
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,469
and was inside
your home.

293
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:38,438
Look, if he wanted me dead,
he would have lain in wait,

294
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,190
not left some
bombastic note.

295
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,341
Holmes...

296
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:42,392
He wants the game.

297
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:43,560
He wants me fully engaged.

298
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:44,761
That's all.

299
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:46,096
If you're concerned,
feel free

300
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,230
to leave additional security

301
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,649
at the back of the building.

302
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:51,568
But I assure you,
I am safe as houses here.

303
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,154
I guess that leaves you,
Miss Watson.

304
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:55,706
I'm staying.

305
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,941
I go where he goes, remember?

306
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,628
Thank you very much.

307
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,830
Good night.

308
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,790
I'm heading to bed.

309
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,094
What's all that?

310
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,428
Oh, it's another

311
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,897
of my father's
properties. I'm...

312
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,299
thinking of moving
when you and I part ways.

313
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,901
Since when?

314
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:26,236
Since our humble home

315
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,438
was penetrated so easily
by a madman.

316
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,974
But you told Captain Gregson
you weren't worried.

317
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:32,159
I'm not.

318
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:33,577
I'm just thinking ahead.

319
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:35,245
My enemies are legion.

Mm-hmm.

361
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,325
Hey... I've
never actually

362
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:20,494
been inside this place.

363
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,813
So, how do you know Sherlock?

364
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,699
A while back, me and a buddy

365
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,084
were scamming
on Washington Square Park.

366
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:31,821
I'd chat the folks up,
Levon'd steal their wallets.

367
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:34,324
No one made us
except for Holmes.

368
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,276
He told us to give
the stuff back.

369
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:37,844
But he didn't
turn us in.

370
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:39,763
Now he just uses us sometimes.

371
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,331
What do you mean
he uses you?

372
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,600
Little earlier he came up
to me and a few of my boys

373
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:46,052
and told us to check out a few
hotels, look for this guy.

374
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:48,305
Said he had a few hundred
for whoever could find him.

375
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:51,274
And I found him--
so I'm here to collect.

376
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:53,727
If this is who I think it is,
he's dangerous.

377
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:56,012
You shouldn't  have been near him.
Yeah, Holmes

378
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:58,114
warned us about sticking
to the public places.

379
00:17:58,116 --> 00:18:00,683
I followed him, even
got him to talk to me,

380
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:03,153
so I could be sure it was him.

381
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:06,856
He's a Brit, just
like Holmes said.

382
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:17,334
Uh, yo.

383
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,037
Is he gonna
be here soon?

384
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,722
'Cause I need to get paid.

385
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:39,856
Care to explain this?

386
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:41,858
I got it

387
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,393
from a friend of yours-- Teddy.

388
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:45,912
No?

389
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:48,081
What about this?

390
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,566
I took a look
around the house

391
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:52,419
while you were out.
I found three others

392
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:54,004
just like it.
I can only imagine

393
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:55,338
how many I didn't find.

394
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,790
That's funny, when
I moved in here,

395
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,425
you didn't mention anything
about your little,

396
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:01,077
uh... surveillance system.

397
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,346
This is my sanctum sanctorum.

398
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:06,433
Did you honestly believe there
wouldn't be security measures?

399
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,584
Okay.

400
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,887
Is that M?

401
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:13,673
You told a bunch of children
to go to upscale hotels

402
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:16,293
to look for him. Why?

403
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,983
Note the hands.

404
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:25,235
Vintage MG driving gloves--
quite expensive.

405
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:28,321
But not nearly as expensive
as his John Varvatos shoes.

406
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:30,040
M has money.

407
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:31,408
That much is obvious.

408
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,410
He's also a recent émigré
to New York.

409
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:36,246
Why did I assume that
he would be in a hotel

410
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:37,964
as opposed to a property
he might own?

411
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,582
Well, it's quite simple.

412
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,217
I noted a curious scent

413
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:42,836
on the note that he left.

414
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:44,087
I quickly realized

415
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,288
it was, in fact,

416
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,622
a combination of scents.

417
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:49,792
Those of the high-end
hand soap and an even

418
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:51,728
higher-end mint-based shampoo.

419
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,630
Each product is used
by various upscale hotels

420
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,816
around the city,
but only one chain,

421
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:59,152
the Betancourt, stocks both.

422
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,937
My lieutenants and I

423
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:03,440
each took a Betancourt,
and watched for M.

424
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,692
That's all very impressive,
but I want to know

425
00:20:05,694 --> 00:20:08,244
why you shared a photo
of a wanted serial killer

426
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,447
with a bunch of kids
instead of going

427
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:12,815
to the NYPD.

428
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:20,173
Several weeks ago, you
learned of the existence

429
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,125
of a woman named
Irene Adler.

430
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,160
I told you she'd died.

431
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:26,513
M killed her.

432
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,848
Obviously, he realized
the degree to which I was assisting

433
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,101
the British police in
their hunt to find him.

434
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,355
He zeroed in on me,
made things personal.

435
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:38,108
As to why I am withholding
information from the NYPD,

436
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,177
it's quite simple:
I have no intention

437
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,113
of capturing M.

438
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:45,532
I have every intention
of torturing...

439
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,734
and murdering him.

440
00:20:58,203 --> 00:21:00,338
What do you mean you plan
to torture and murder M?

441
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:03,457
Hard to imagine I could have
been much clearer, Watson.

442
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,076
Hey, this
isn't a joke.

443
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:06,994
No. This is revenge.

444
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,180
Wait, how are
you so calm?

445
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:11,932
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

446
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,684
I'm not calm.

447
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm merely presenting
a calm exterior.

448
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:17,671
Inside, I am roiling.

449
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,244
I've been dreaming
about this moment

450
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,997
quite some time:
one year, six months,

451
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,065
22 days, to be exact.

452
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:27,067
That's when he killed her.

453
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,836
Irene.

454
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:32,707
We'd been together
seven months by then.

455
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,793
I won't bore you with
the details of our courtship.

456
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,928
Suffice it to say...

457
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,680
I was quite smitten.

458
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,632
Up until that point in my life,

459
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,351
I'd found most women
quite boring--

460
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:47,305
a perfumed and pillowy means to
a physiological end.

461
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,806
Irene was different.

462
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,358
You were in love.

463
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,863
Prior to her murder,
my drug use had been...

464
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:57,114
recreational.

465
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,932
Something to do
when I was bored

466
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:01,935
or in need of a boost
during a particularly

467
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:03,437
challenging investigation.

468
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:06,273
After Irene,
well, I lost control.

469
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,626
I used... various stimulants

470
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:12,630
as I tried to help
the authorities identify M.

471
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,082
Once went several weeks
without sleeping. Yeah.

472
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,335
When the trail
finally went cold,

473
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,337
I turned to opiates.

474
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,121
Look, I'm grateful
to know the whole story,

475
00:22:21,123 --> 00:22:22,807
but you've come
a long way since London.

476
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,291
I'm not gonna let you

477
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:26,394
risk it all by chasing
down a psychopath.

478
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:28,929
You know, I don't think
you understand, Watson.

479
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,799
Without you, none of this
would have been possible.

480
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:33,818
Everything that you've helped me
do these past six weeks--

481
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,603
every-every meeting
you've dragged me to,

482
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,488
every exercise
you've compelled me to perform--

483
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,740
it's all been in preparation
for this moment.

484
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:41,642
I'm not throwing away
anything I've learned.

485
00:22:41,644 --> 00:22:43,477
I'm using it.

486
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:47,164
I am as clearheaded and
as focused as I have ever been.

487
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,334
There's a clarity
to my thinking that's...

488
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,169
frightening.

489
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,039
I didn't help you stay sober
so you could become a murderer.

490
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,491
Well, you didn't realize
that's what you were doing.

491
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,493
Nor did I.

492
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:01,178
Not until I walked in

493
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,047
on that crime scene
the other day.

494
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,466
I saw M's handiwork.

495
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,268
I realized I'd been
given a second chance.

496
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,336
Is that why you didn't
want me to help you

497
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:10,671
with the M files
the other day?

498
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:11,839
Because you knew
I'd see Irene's name

499
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,274
and realize you were
up to something?

500
00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:15,676
I was the only one who
could make that connection.

501
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:17,344
I'd hoped we would never have
to have this conversation.

502
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:18,896
I don't want you feeling
responsible for something

503
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,564
that I have to do.
You lied to me

504
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,450
because you know what you're
planning to do is wrong.

505
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:23,784
If you were considering
following me,

506
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:25,903
I strongly advise against it.

507
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,121
I'm not gonna follow you.

508
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:29,022
But you know

509
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,191
that I'm gonna have to
call Captain Gregson.

510
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:33,244
You do as you feel
you must, Watson.

511
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,463
I'll do the same.

512
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:44,755
Whoa!

513
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,207
Theodore.

514
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,376
Heard you met another
of my associates today.

515
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:51,262
She said you had
something for me.

516
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,646
That depends.

517
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,265
You got something
for me?

518
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,433
Right.

519
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,436
Now, tell me everything
you saw today.

520
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,554
Pizzas come savory
and they come sweet.

521
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:03,056
With the pizza dough you can do
a lot of different things.

522
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,860
First thing I want to do
is melt some butter.

523
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,578
So I'm going to brush
the pizza dough...

524
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:11,198
...just to give it
a little bit of a...

525
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,338
What is it?

526
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,574
Flour the board a little bit
so the dough doesn't stick,

527
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:22,009
flour your rolling pin...

528
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,211
Bavaro, you okay?

529
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,479
Where the heck did you get that?

530
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,442
Son of a bitch.

531
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,110
I am pissed.

532
00:24:57,112 --> 00:24:58,779
I get revenge.

533
00:24:58,781 --> 00:25:02,049
I've lost friends
on the job to scumbags.

534
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:03,384
Believe me,
there's been more

535
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:04,668
than a few times I thought about

536
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,453
taking things into my own hands.

537
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:08,622
But I didn't. Now,
he may not be a cop,

538
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:11,058
but he's been
around law enforcement

539
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,760
long enough
to know that.

540
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,345
This Teddy kid.

541
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,013
What did he say
about the killer?

542
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,148
Just that he was staying
at an upscale hotel.

543
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,768
Sherlock deduced that it was,
uh, the Betancourt chain.

544
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,103
I'm gonna have my guys go to
all the Betancourt hotels,

545
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,855
see if we can't
scoop him up.

546
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,441
I don't think M is the only one
we need to be looking for.

547
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,613
If he isn't at his hotel,
Sherlock may already have him.

548
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,499
Arsenal looking a bit ragged now
as play continues.

549
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,501
Santiago moving right.
The young Spaniard

550
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:39,987
looking good here in his first
match. Taylor tracking back

551
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:41,655
through midfield,
nipping at his heels.

552
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:43,374
Oh, and a hard tackle
from Taylor.

553
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,758
Looks like Browns is reaching

554
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,660
for his pocket.
Yes, a yellow card here

555
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:49,162
for Taylor in the 70th minute.
That'll certainly make things

556
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:50,765
interesting for the Gunners
as they cling

557
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,332
to a tenuous one-nil lead.

558
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:55,019
That's a joke.
He hardly touched him.

559
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,021
Arsenal fan.

560
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,773
As if I didn't have enough
reasons to despise you.

561
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,025
You.

562
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,226
Me.

563
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,445
Baton.

564
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:38,445
I hope you don't mind being

565
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:40,580
hung right-side up--
I know you prefer the opposite

566
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,032
for your victims.

567
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:50,207
You figured out
where you're gonna start yet?

568
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,659
I have not.

569
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:54,845
I had hoped
to use the...

570
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,797
bees in some fashion,
but then it occurred to me

571
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,166
you might be allergic.

572
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:03,270
After all this trouble, I'd hate
for our fun to be over too soon.

573
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:05,939
That would be a pity.

574
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,441
Bit surprised at you, though.

575
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:11,728
I thought you as more
of a by-the-book kind of bloke.

576
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,681
So, why here, huh?

577
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,566
Why not take me straight
to the nick?

578
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:20,186
I think you know why.

579
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:21,788
I think I don't.

580
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,075
Irene.

581
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:29,746
Pretending the name
isn't familiar to you

582
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,365
will not make things
any easier for you.

583
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,337
Addison?

584
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,712
Adler.

585
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,682
Irene Adler.

586
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:52,068
Got killed
in her flat,

587
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,405
Camden Lock,
about a year and a half ago.

588
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,944
Sorry to disappoint you,
mate, but it wasn't me.

589
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,163
No, of course it wasn't.

590
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,064
It was probably
the other blood-draining madman

591
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:08,168
with the tripod device, hmm?

592
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,537
I was banged up in Brixton
for six months.

593
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,255
Not for the killing,
of course.

594
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,741
I had a misunderstanding
with a Man United fan.

595
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:17,711
He was running around
slagging off the Arsenal.

596
00:28:17,713 --> 00:28:19,546
Didn't paralyze him.
I just

597
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,348
bashed him up a bit.

598
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,683
And while I was
doing the stretch,

599
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:28,605
read in the papers that the
notorious "M" had struck again.

600
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,423
Imagine my surprise.

601
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,059
But you disappoint me.

602
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,979
And Scotland Yard, of course.

603
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,765
Falling for that copycat
so easily?

604
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:48,074
Tell me. You and Miss Adler

605
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,826
an item?

606
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,828
I have to say, I'm a little
disappointed in you.

607
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,463
I thought you'd be
a much better liar.

608
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,614
I'm not lying.

609
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,449
Well, why would you

610
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:58,835
when facing an agonizing death?

611
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,438
Ex-Royal Marine.

612
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,772
Death's an old friend.

613
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,391
Is he?

614
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:07,460
What about torture?

615
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:09,312
Is he an old friend, too?

616
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:14,401
You made me a shambles of a man.

617
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:17,103
Now I'm simply
returning the favor.

618
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:22,659
I was on the floor.

619
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,494
I was screaming,

620
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,897
but the tape was so tight
around my mouth, I cou...

621
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,667
Oh, oh.
I couldn't...

622
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,639
It's okay.
It's okay, Ms. Cullen.

623
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,491
Take your time.

624
00:29:34,493 --> 00:29:37,410
That's when I saw
the second man's feet.

625
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,479
He walked right by me.

626
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,147
Did you get a look at his face?

627
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:43,199
Um...

628
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:46,753
He said something
to the man who tied me up,

629
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:52,375
but I-I couldn't hear them over
the TV, but then after a minute,

630
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:55,512
the second man came back
into the hall.

631
00:29:55,514 --> 00:29:58,498
He said he would cut me free.

632
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,601
He said he didn't want me
to turn around.

633
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,937
And he said
I should wait ten minutes

634
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:07,173
and then call the police.

635
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:09,059
He even said, "Please."

636
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:11,144
Dr. Klein. Paging Dr. Klein.

637
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:12,645
Did he have
an accent?

638
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:14,097
I think he was British.

639
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:17,951
I think the first man
was British, too.

640
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:20,336
He was watching
a British soccer game...

641
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:22,806
on my TV.

642
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:26,543
Do you remember any other
details about either man?

643
00:30:26,545 --> 00:30:28,962
The second one,

644
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:30,663
the one that set me free--

645
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:32,432
he had some sort of chalk

646
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:34,551
on his shoes.
Chalk?

647
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:36,970
Powder.

648
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:38,104
It was white.

649
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:40,256
Miss Cullen?

650
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:43,560
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse us.

651
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:46,396
I think I know
where Sherlock went.

652
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:47,814
Last night
he was looking at photos

653
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:49,015
of one of his father's

654
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:50,300
other properties in New York.

655
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:51,884
He said
he was thinking about moving.

656
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,719
But maybe he was looking
for a place

657
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,321
to take M after he found him.

658
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:57,407
Well, what makes you think
that would be the place?

659
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:59,392
It was being renovated. There
was white powder everywhere.

660
00:30:59,394 --> 00:31:00,577
Do you have an address?

661
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:02,529
No.

662
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,415
I think I know
how we can find one.

663
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:20,580
Anybody ever tell you
you punch like a woman?

664
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,132
Yeah, a woman did once.

665
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:23,916
But she was much bigger than me.

666
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:26,136
And the abductor of young girls

667
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:30,106
that she used to turn a profit
in the sex trade, so...

668
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:33,726
Well, for a ponce,
you move pretty quick.

669
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:37,430
What, I dropped my first body
here, what, 72 hours ago?

670
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:39,149
What'd you do,
jump on a plane?

671
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:41,534
Where am I supposed
to have flown in from?

672
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:44,821
Uh... London?

673
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:47,040
What makes you think
I'd gone back there?

674
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,958
What are you talking about,
"gone back"?

675
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,794
You trying to tell me
you live here now?

676
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:52,278
You know I live here.

677
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,214
You were in my home
the other night.

678
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:57,133
You left a note.
That's how I found you.

679
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,637
That was your place?

680
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:03,256
You don't look well, M.

681
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:06,392
You-You don't mind
if I call you M, do you?

682
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:09,729
Something's not right.

683
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:13,299
I'm not what you think I am.

684
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:16,152
I'm not a serial killer.
I'm an assassin.

685
00:32:16,154 --> 00:32:17,604
I have an employer.

686
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:20,640
Listen...

687
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:23,109
I received the names of everyone
I killed for him.

688
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,861
He pays me.

689
00:32:24,863 --> 00:32:28,581
I already told you you're
a terrible liar, didn't I?

690
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,783
I'm not lying.

691
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:36,005
He sold me out.

692
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:38,258
He never told me you was here.

693
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,342
Who didn't?

694
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:40,627
My employer.

695
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:43,129
The MOs, the notes,

696
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:46,266
all that "serial killer"
bollocks! That was him!

697
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:48,635
Let's pretend
that I believe you.

698
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:52,222
What was his motive
for killing 37 people?

699
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,726
I don't know.
I never met him.

700
00:32:56,728 --> 00:33:00,563
He sends me coded message
on my cell phone.

701
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:03,116
It's there in my jacket.

702
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:05,568
Have a look
if you don't believe me.

703
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,362
Gobbledygook.

704
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:17,747
Proves nothing.

705
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:20,917
Sebastian Moran--
that's my real name.

706
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:23,503
Look it up!

707
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,838
The fight I was in--
there was a trial,

708
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
it was in the papers.

709
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:29,309
I couldn't have hurt
your girl.

710
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:30,727
You'll see
I'm telling the truth.

711
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:33,763
He always
talked about you.

712
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,566
Must have been

713
00:33:36,568 --> 00:33:37,567
obsessed or something.

714
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:38,718
Had a fascination.

715
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,103
He never told me you was here,

716
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,721
and he sure as hell
never told me

717
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:43,523
that was your apartment
I broke into.

718
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:46,442
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's the one that killed your

719
00:33:46,444 --> 00:33:47,727
precious Irene.

720
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,562
No.

721
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:51,230
Don't let him play you as well.

722
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:52,332
No.

723
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:53,899
It's you.

724
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,251
Has to be.

725
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:57,236
Listen.

726
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:59,071
You can kill me
for all the others,

727
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:00,590
but your girl...

728
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:03,760
that was him.

729
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:05,962
That was Moriarty.

730
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,550
Just heard
from the Buildings Department,

731
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,418
and they said
that Holmes' dad's company

732
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,770
applied for a remodeling permit

733
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,795
about six months ago
on a loft in Brooklyn.

734
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:17,473
The address is

735
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,192
3203 North Sixth Street.

736
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:21,311
They got any other building
permits out at the moment?

737
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:22,612
No.
Well, then,

738
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:23,896
let's assume that's the one

739
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:24,897
we're looking for.

740
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,733
Tell ESU to meet me there.

741
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:29,285
Moriarty's who you want, not me.

742
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:34,457
I seem to recall you saying
you were not afraid to die.

743
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:37,577
It's not fear
I'm feeling right now.

744
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,612
It's anger.

745
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:42,332
Righteous anger.

746
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:45,134
Moriarty sold me out,
and I'm gonna get even.

747
00:34:45,136 --> 00:34:47,387
You're a monster.

748
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,589
A sadist.

749
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:51,791
A murderer.

750
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,629
All of those...

751
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:58,014
but I'm not

752
00:34:58,016 --> 00:34:59,799
a liar.

753
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:01,934
Reach out
to Brixton Prison,

754
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:04,854
they'll tell you
that I was locked up

755
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:06,439
when Irene was killed.

756
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:07,824
No.

757
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:10,827
I couldn't have been
in two places at once.

758
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:12,912
Look at me, Holmes.

759
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:15,365
I'm telling the truth.
You killed her.

760
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:16,833
I never touched
a hair on her head!

761
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:18,001
You killed her.

762
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:27,126
Moriarty said you was
obsessed with puzzles.

763
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:31,014
But he's greatest puzzle
you'll ever come across.

764
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:32,849
You kill me now,

765
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:37,720
and you'll be killing
the best clue you ever had.

766
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:49,482
I knew you'd make
the right decision.

767
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:53,369
You're a rare thing
in this world, Holmes.

768
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:55,822
You're an honorable man.

769
00:35:55,824 --> 00:35:58,458
A famous statistician
once stated

770
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,327
that while the individual man
is an insoluble puzzle,

771
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:04,881
in the aggregate he becomes
a mathematical certainty.

772
00:36:04,883 --> 00:36:07,250
You can,
for example,

773
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,302
never foretell
what any one man will do.

774
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:10,920
But you can, with precision,

775
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:14,223
say what an average man will do.

776
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:16,809
Individuals vary,

777
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,095
percentages remain constant.

778
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:22,098
So says the
statistician.

779
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,102
I am not an average man.

780
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,060
Stay here.

781
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:43,753
Holmes! If you're in here, get
down on the ground right now!

782
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:45,371
Clear!

783
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:46,672
Clear!

784
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:50,376
Yeah.

785
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:52,845
Are you kidding me?

786
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:53,880
Were we too late?

787
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:54,847
Yeah, we were.

788
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,516
Just got a call from Bell.

789
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,885
Holmes just walked into the
station five minutes ago...

790
00:36:58,887 --> 00:37:01,053
with M.

791
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:06,425
For the last time, mate,
Holmes did not abduct me.

792
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:08,861
I lured him
to Miss Cullen's place,

793
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:12,482
and then he followed me
to that loft.

794
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:14,951
A loft just happened to
be owned by his father?

795
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:16,919
Yeah, I was aware of that.

796
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:21,040
I just thought it'd be pretty
cool if they found Holmes' body

797
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,725
at his father's property.

798
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:24,861
Can you explain your injuries

799
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:26,262
one more time?

800
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,582
I went at him.

801
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:32,635
He defended himself.

802
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,303
It's as simple as that.

803
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:36,055
He stabbed you.

804
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:37,924
Eventually, yeah.

805
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:39,809
Miracle, really.

806
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:42,211
He missed every major organ,

807
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:44,564
according to the doc that looked
me over in the cell.

808
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:45,765
Lucky.

809
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,683
What can I say?

810
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:50,302
I've led a charmed life.

811
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:03,366
You're missing out
on quite a story back there.

812
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,922
The stab wound
he sustained?

813
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:11,591
He claims he got it
in a struggle,

814
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:13,009
but I'm pretty sure if he had,

815
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:16,179
there would've
been more damage.

816
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,950
Looks more like he was
stationary.

817
00:38:20,952 --> 00:38:23,102
Maybe even restrained.

818
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:25,304
I used to be
a surgeon.

819
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:27,590
I don't know if I could've found
a way to stab a man

820
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:29,442
without actually doing
any real harm.

821
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:31,944
If that's what
you meant

822
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:35,531
to do, I'm impressed.

823
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,884
If you're trying to make
some sort of point...

824
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:39,352
He presumed to know me

825
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:43,356
and he needed to be shown
that he did not.

826
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:45,524
He says he's willing to confess
to all the murders,

827
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:46,926
but he won't give you up.

828
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:51,764
He believes that
he's been wronged.

829
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:53,583
He thinks
I'm the best chance he has

830
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:57,036
at bringing whoever wronged him
to justice.

831
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:58,838
Are you planning on helping him?

832
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:03,526
He killed Irene.

833
00:39:03,528 --> 00:39:06,996
No.

834
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:09,265
As it turns out, he did not.

835
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:11,200
He was
incarcerated

836
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:13,336
at the time she died.

837
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:17,406
I confirmed it
a short while ago.

838
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:25,898
I'm sorry that I lied
to you, Watson.

839
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:31,370
The last few days have been
quite... vexing.

840
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:33,089
Even now, I'm
not certain

841
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:36,626
if I've done the right thing
in allowing M to live.

842
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:40,029
It's strange,
really.

843
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:43,165
I'm rarely conflicted
about the decisions I make.

844
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:46,969
That's the beauty of deductive
reasoning, I suppose.

845
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:51,590
It makes a science
of almost everything.

846
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:58,397
Not this.

847
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:26,592
I'm gonna miss this.

848
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:36,319
Maybe not this so much.

849
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:40,906
But this.

850
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:43,192
Working with you.

851
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,280
I think what you do is amazing.

852
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:56,839
I'm sorry our last days together
had to go so poorly.

853
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:13,491
Hi, this is Joan Watson calling
from New York.

854
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:17,379
Is Mr. Holmes available?

855
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:18,913
Okay.

856
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:23,868
Can you just tell him...

857
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,220
I'm worried about his son

858
00:41:25,222 --> 00:41:27,973
and I'd like to stay on
a bit longer?

859
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:53,682
Watson, what is it?

860
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:57,952
Um, I called your
father last night.

861
00:41:57,954 --> 00:41:59,421
Given everything
that's happened,

862
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:01,423
I recommended
staying on a while longer.

863
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:03,792
And?

864
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:05,760
He agreed.

865
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:10,632
I suppose the apiary will have
to wait.

866
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:18,640
