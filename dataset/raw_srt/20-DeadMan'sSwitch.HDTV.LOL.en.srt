1
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:16,746
Close your mouth, Watson.
You'll catch a fly.

2
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,915
I didn't you had
one of those machines.

3
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,917
Only needle these arms
see anymore.

4
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,919
I keep it for the
occasional touch-up.

5
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,455
Well, wouldn't it be easier
if someone else did it,

6
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:26,756
like an actual
tattoo artist?

7
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:28,124
I am an actual
tattoo artist.

8
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:29,292
I did a lot
of these myself.

9
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,661
How'd you...?
Ambidextrous.

10
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:33,046
Of course you are.

11
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:36,132
Can I interest you in
some ink of your own?

12
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:38,134
Syringe with a line
through it, perhaps,

13
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:40,804
in honor of your former
career as a sober companion?

14
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:42,338
I think I'm good, thanks.

15
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,173
I wanted to plan something
for your anniversary.

16
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:46,276
You're gonna be one-year sober
in a few days.

17
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,812
They're gonna give you your
one-year chip at your next meeting.

18
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:51,064
It's a big deal, Sherlock.
You should be proud.

19
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:53,283
You've been talking to Alfredo.
He's been hounding me

20
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55,018
about my soberversary
for weeks now.

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,703
Of course he has.
He's your sponsor.

22
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,405
Which is why I have not had

23
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,189
the heart to tell him
I've absolutely no intention

24
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:02,826
of accepting that chip.
And why wouldn't you accept it?

25
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:05,078
It is absurd to measure
sobriety in units of time.

26
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,465
It is a state of being. One is
either in it or out of it.

27
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:10,050
In my case, I am in it

28
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,584
permanently.

29
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:13,870
Amassing a collection of cheap
plastic discs seems infantile.

30
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:16,556
Unless, of course, I could
trade them in for a prize.

31
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:18,008
A brood of sea monkeys, perhaps.

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,142
Sherlock...

33
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:20,477
You're a ex-sober
companion.

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,145
It is no longer
your calling

35
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,847
to nag me, police me
or reproach me.

36
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:26,182
If I require your opinion
with regards to my sobriety,

37
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:27,334
I will ask for it.

38
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:30,103
You are right.

39
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,442
Ha.

40
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:38,411
Alfredo, your ears
must have been burning.

41
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:41,614
Hope I'm not calling too early.
I'm with a friend.

42
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:45,952
I think he could use your help.

43
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:10,944
Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson.
We're here to see Ken Whitman.

44
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:14,263
Uh, my dad. He said
someone was coming by.

45
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:15,732
Come in.

46
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,508
You're quite good.

47
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,244
Eva. Thanks.

48
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:32,549
Uh, Dad's in the den,
just... down the hall.

49
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,719
I told you when I met you
that I had a great sponsor.

50
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,921
This is him.

51
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,589
The only one in the group
willing to take a chance

52
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:41,641
on a half-reformed
ex-car thief.

53
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:44,010
Alfredo said you
were in trouble.

54
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:48,431
Two years ago,
Eva used a fake I.D.

55
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,417
to get into a club
in the city.

56
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,237
A man named Brent Garvey slipped
something into her drink.

57
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,522
He took her

58
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:59,359
to his apartment and...

59
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:01,027
The next morning

60
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:02,946
she told me
and her mom everything.

61
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:06,166
We took her to the police
and they found Garvey.

62
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,418
She picked him out
of a lineup.

63
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,370
Brave girl.
After Garvey

64
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:13,423
was charged, two other
victims came forward.

65
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:15,208
He ended up
cutting a deal.

66
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,326
Pled guilty
for a reduced sentence.

67
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:18,928
Technically, it was over.

68
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,097
But not for you
and your family.

69
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,099
For Eva,
it was hard.

70
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:26,002
She cut off contact
with her friends.

71
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:27,604
Stopped playing.

72
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:30,023
Even tried
to hurt herself.

73
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,142
We found her
a therapist.

74
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,310
Things... got better.

75
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:38,514
She said she might even be ready
for college next year.

76
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,016
And then

77
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:43,653
a few months ago,
I got this in the mail.

78
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,539
It's a-a video of Eva

79
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,708
with Brent Garvey.

80
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,912
The night he...

81
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,866
"Mr. Whitman,

82
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,135
you will transfer
$10,000 to the following account

83
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,370
"or this video
will be posted online

84
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:02,972
"and released to the media.

85
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,974
"Your daughter will be a star.

86
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,310
"Do not go
to the police,

87
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,878
"do not attempt
to identify me.

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,897
"If I'm arrested or
physically harmed in any way,

89
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,932
"I have a fail-safe
in place,

90
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,885
an associate who will
release the video for me""

91
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:18,188
Eva had come
such a long way.

92
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,274
I didn't want to see her
get hurt again.

93
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,909
So you paid the $10,000.

94
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,611
I didn't even
tell my wife.

95
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,395
I just did it.

96
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:29,199
But then...
a few weeks later...

97
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,234
They asked for
more money.

98
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,119
I paid again.

99
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:36,089
The third demand
came a few days ago.

100
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:38,842
I finally lost it.

101
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:41,544
Came close
to falling off the wagon.

102
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:45,215
My sponsor was out of town,
so I-I reached out to Alfredo.

103
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:48,218
I-I just needed
to talk to someone.

104
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,937
But then he told me about you.

105
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,224
H-He said you might
be able to help?

106
00:04:56,361 --> 00:05:00,530
I have a particular
disdain for blackmailers.

107
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,532
They are...

108
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,534
in some respects...

109
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:07,737
more despicable to me
than even murderers.

110
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:11,541
Ms. Watson and I will find the
person who's been targeting you.

111
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:14,627
We will also find their
associate. Then...

112
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:18,447
we will destroy every trace
of this vile recording.

113
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,841
You think he's
the blackmailer.

114
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:32,095
My tech expert in London traced
the account number

115
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:35,231
on the note to that man
and this address.

116
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:38,101
Charles Augustus
Milverton.

117
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,569
He certainly
looks the part.

118
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:41,738
I'm just surprised how
easy it was to find him.

119
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,489
Well, he's obviously confident
in the protection

120
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:46,976
that his fail-safe
affords him.

121
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,245
I'll assess the threat he poses,

122
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,498
and attempt to divine the
identity of his accomplice.

123
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,084
Once both individuals
are known to us,

124
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:58,621
we will destroy their blackmail
troves simultaneously.

125
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:25,698
Another reason
to dislike Milverton...

126
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,234
he keeps cats.

127
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:30,370
Well, he should get himself
a real pet,

128
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:32,188
like a beehive.

129
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,406
You see anything?

130
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,158
Laptop.

131
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,693
He could have used it
to burn the DVD

132
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:39,162
that he sent.

133
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:59,132
What's happening?

134
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,884
Ken Whitman said the man who
assaulted his daughter

135
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:03,770
took two other teenaged victims,
as well--

136
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,605
Tracy Bender and Karen Pistone.

137
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,158
There are videos of them
here, as well.

138
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,694
You think he's blackmailing
their parents?

139
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:12,912
Them. Others.

140
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,247
"Others"?

141
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,898
It would seem Mr. Milverton

142
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,867
is a professional blackmailer.

143
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:21,104
I'd estimate that his victims
number in the dozens.

144
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,509
He's back.

145
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,261
He must have just gone
to get some groceries.

146
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:29,545
He's heading for the door.

147
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:38,254
You could have specified
back door, Watson.

148
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:40,497
What're you talking about?
He's coming through the front.

149
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,387

162
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,993
is Brent Garvey.

163
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,012
He was arrested in New
Jersey several years ago

164
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:27,465
and convicted of sexually
assaulting three young women:

165
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,300
Eva Whitman, Tracy Bender,

166
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,269
Karen Pistone.

167
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,139
Eva Whitman's father received
that DVD in the mail,

168
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,609
along with a note which demanded
that he pay $10,000

169
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,612
or see it released
on the Internet.

170
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,564
Now, I identified
the blackmailer

171
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,115
earlier this evening.

172
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,567
I went to his home

173
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,837
and I realized that he had sent
similar threats

174
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,739
to the parents of Ms. Bender
and Ms. Pistone.

175
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:54,509
So you're here to turn
over the evidence.

176
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,177
Well...

177
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,748
It's possible...

178
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,285
that I am here to report

179
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:05,720
a murder.

180
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,339
Or perhaps I'm just here to...

181
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,159
seek the counsel
of an investigator

182
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:14,495
that I respect and admire.

183
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:20,401
Hypothetically,

184
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:23,188
the blackmailer was killed
in his home tonight.

185
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,939
Hypothetically...

186
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,192
I saw it happen.

187
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,564
Holmes...

188
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,501
if you know anything
about a murder,

189
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,370
you gotta report it.

190
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,456
There would be consequences.

191
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,593
The hypothetical blackmailer
had a hypothetical accomplice.

192
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,345
That accomplice,
upon learning of

193
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,047
his partner's death,
would release

194
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,417
that video-- and others--
into the world.

195
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,285
That is, of course,

196
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:57,255
if the accomplice learns of

197
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,157
his partner's death.

198
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,759
So you want to keep it a secret.

199
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,028
It would give
a motivated investigator

200
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,231
enough time to identify
the accomplice,

201
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,817
prevent him from enacting
any offending fail-safes.

202
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,537
Obviously you'd want
to find the accomplice

203
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,622
more than the killer but...

204
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:17,408
what if the killer
is the accomplice?

205
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,561
Then all roads lead to Mecca.

206
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:23,531
Blackmailer is foiled
and a killer is caught.

207
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,400
All in one fell swoop.

208
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:31,756
You have daughters,
do you not, Captain?

209
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:39,297
So...

210
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,965
Captain Gregson
sees the wisdom

211
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,601
in keeping Milverton's
death a secret. For now.

212
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,436
Well, I've been listening
to the scanner since I got back

213
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,971
and there
are no reports of gunfire

214
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,472
or break-ins
in Milverton's neighborhood.

215
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,607
Did you reach Alfredo?

216
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,276
Yeah, he said
he would stay there

217
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,860
as long as
we needed him to.

218
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,696
He'd let us know
if anyone came by.

219
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:57,365
What about the materials I
took from the dead man's desk?

220
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,667
Well, they're bills mostly.
I have some receipts.

221
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,252
Um, I did find this.

222
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,954
I think it's
some sort of ledger.

223
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,009
Hmm.

224
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:11,796
Records of payoffs
from Milverton's victims probably.

225
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,232
How are you doing?

226
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,969
You saw someone
get murdered tonight.

227
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,225
You said you never got
a clean look at the shooter.

228
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:25,843
Large man, approximately
six foot two,

229
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,178
one hundred kilograms.

230
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,646
His features were
obscured by a mask,

231
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,815
his scent by the cat urine
and kitty litter

232
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,899
in Milverton's home.

233
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,618
Even if I had
reported the crime,

234
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,853
I would not have had
much to offer.

235
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,790
It's hard not to imagine that
the killer was one of the people

236
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,825
Milverton was blackmailing,
but the captain raised

237
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,960
the possibility that
it was his accomplice.

238
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,912
Either way, our goal
remains the same:

239
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:49,533
Find the fail-safe before he can
release any salacious material.

240
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,053
Well, if the killer was one
of Milverton's victims,

241
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:54,889
why wouldn't he be worried
about the fail-safe kicking in?

242
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,091
Well, it's possible that he
solved whatever problem

243
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,476
Milverton was
taking advantage of.

244
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,511
The fail-safe would
mean nothing to him.

245
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,730
Unfortunately,
it still means a great deal

246
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:04,232
to Milverton's other victims.

247
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:05,716
The parents
of the three young women raped

248
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,353
by Brent Garvey, for example.

249
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,355
I've arranged to pay him
a visit in the morning.

250
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,906
Garvey?

251
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,324
What if Garvey was

252
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,026
the accomplice
Milverton entrusted

253
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,194
his fail-safe protocols with?

254
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,196
He's in prison--
how could he...?

255
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,864
All he would need to release
those videos is access

256
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,732
to a smartphone or a computer.

257
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,836
Neither, I'm sorry to say, is
impossible to come by in lockup.

258
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,404
If he is not the accomplice,

259
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,239
perhaps he can tell us who is.

260
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,384
Mr. Garvey.

261
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,586
I heard the victimizers
of children

262
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,222
had a rough time in prison.

263
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,257
It's really nice to see
that it's not just a rumor.

264
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,426
Who are you?

265
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,695
I'm Holmes,
this is Watson.

266
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,697
We consult for the New York
Police Department.

267
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,149
If this is about
the guys who jumped me,

268
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,767
I already gave
their names to the guards.

269
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,203
We're here to talk to you
about Charles Milverton.

270
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,373
Before you say you've never
heard of him, be advised

271
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,775
we come fresh from
a conversation with your warden.

272
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,296
We know that he paid you
a visit here several months ago.

273
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,749
Yeah, he's friends with my dad.

274
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,718
He came to see how I was doing.

275
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,171
Is that why you gave him your
collection of rape tapes?

276
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:20,091
I don't know what
you're talking about.

277
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,625
I've seen the tapes, Garvey.

278
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,178
I have one in my possession.

279
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:27,565
I'm very seriously
considering telling your friends

280
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,901
here about them
before I leave today.

281
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:33,087
Maybe they won't wait to find
you in the yard next time.

282
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,690
Maybe they'll pay you a visit
in your sickbed.

283
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,625
We know you gave
Milverton the tapes.

284
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,277
We just want to know
if you have access

285
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,145
to any of his other
blackmail materials.

286
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,448
Other materials?
Milverton had

287
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,933
an accomplice-- someone who
would put forth his materials

288
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,953
in the event of his untimely
death or incarceration.

289
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,338
The fail-safe, yeah.

290
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,806
Yeah, I know.

291
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,076
He told me all about him
when he came to see me.

292
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,211
He said if I went to the police

293
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,796
and I told them
he was blackmailing me,

294
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,298
his partner would
release the tapes.

295
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,266
Blackmailing you?

296
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,668
I didn't give him the tapes.

297
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,888
I had them in a storage unit.

298
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,640
When I got arrested, I couldn't
keep up with the payments.

299
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,859
The contents went
into auction.

300
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:14,278
Milverton put in
the highest bid.

301
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,647
Said he bought
old units all the time.

302
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,516
Got a lot of dirt that way.

303
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:22,487
Let me guess-- you have
a parole hearing coming up?

304
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,704
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

305
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,823
I'm not in on it
with these guys.

306
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,912
So, what's the verdict
on Garvey?

307
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:41,448
Well, as far as rapists go,

308
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,117
it would appear
he's an honest one.

309
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,072
After Milverton's initial
visit to him in prison,

310
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,707
he sent...

311
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,543
he sent a series of
e-mails to his parents,

312
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:55,712
begging for loans.

313
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:57,464
The dates of those
e-mails correspond

314
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:00,183
to payments made in
Milverton's ledger.

315
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:03,770
So Milverton was blackmailing
Garvey and Garvey was paying.

316
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:05,389
But we're still
gonna tell the police

317
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:08,692
about the videos before
his parole hearing, right?

318
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:11,111
We will discuss the matter
with the three girls' parents

319
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:12,396
at the appropriate time.

320
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:14,231
The decision should
and will be theirs.

321
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,999
In the meantime, we
will stay the course

322
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:18,235
and attempt to identify
Milverton's accessory.

323
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:21,271
Before he find out
that Milverton is dead.

324
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,489
Got it.

325
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:25,075
I found something
in his ledger.

326
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:27,577
He makes regular outgoing
payments to someone

327
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,880
with the code name "HENRY8""

328
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,415
You think that's
the accomplice?

329
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,883
The payments are
consistently ten percent

330
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,168
of whatever Milverton
has coming in.

331
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,786
Seems like a reasonable rate

332
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,140
for a blackmailer's assistant.

333
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:42,676
--Oh.

334
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:45,345
It's Alfredo--
someone's at Milverton's door.

335
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,945
He's gone.

336
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:04,247
Right after I texted you,
he hopped into a cab.

337
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,116
Tried to tail him
but I lost him in traffic.

338
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,918
Description?

339
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,337
Tall, six feet, maybe, fat,

340
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,038
gray hair, mustache.

341
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,124
Suit and cowboy boots--
it's weird, I mean...

342
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:15,658
something about him.

343
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,877
Something like what?

344
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,661
He seemed familiar,
like I knew him

345
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,464
or something.
Any idea from where?

346
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:23,133
I don't know. Maybe I saw him
at a meeting or maybe...

347
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,667
maybe I stole his car
back in the day.

348
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,553
You said he was wearing cowboy boots.
Yeah.

349
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:29,389
What matters is that
your eyes beheld him.

350
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,107
Which means his image
was transmitted

351
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:33,343
to your posterior
parietal cortex.

352
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,629
So, once we regress you,

353
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:37,847
you'll remember every detail,

354
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,483
including where
you know him from.

355
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,518
Re-what me?
Regress you.

356
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,653
Normally, we would use
a sensory deprivation chamber.

357
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,539
But in the absence of that.

358
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,824
You want me to get in there?
Yeah.

359
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:49,910
You grew up in New York?
Well, yeah.

360
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:51,995
You watch late-night TV?
Ah, of course.

361
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:53,380
Is this the guy you saw?

362
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:55,165
Involved in an automobile accident?

363
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,833
Well, there's
a new sheriff in town.

364
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:59,002
Me-- Duke Landers, Esquire.
That's him.

365
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,304
"Come on down
and see Sheriff Duke."

366
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,590
If you're looking
for justice and money,

367
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:06,309
come on down
and see Sheriff Duke.

368
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:09,312
Charles Milverton.

369
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:11,848
Sorry, name doesn't ring a bell.

370
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,400
That's funny, Sheriff,

371
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:15,068
because you were seen
knocking on his door

372
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,403
in Staten Island
this morning.

373
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:18,572
Can you prove that?

374
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:20,023
No.

375
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:22,192
Nor can we prove
that Milverton was your client.

376
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,077
Or that he left certain
materials with you,

377
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,280
and told you to disperse them
should certain fates befall him.

378
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:30,000
Say this Milverton guy
is a client.

379
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:33,003
The law would proscribe me
from discussing him

380
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,272
with you in any way.

381
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,407
So, now, if you'll excuse me.

382
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,876
"Duke Landers, Esquire."

383
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:43,246
I take it the title refers
to your law license as opposed

384
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,682
to your birthright
as the eldest son

385
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:47,750
of a knight.

386
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,419
What are you doing?

387
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,304
Yeah.

388
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,723
Thought so-- this
paper is 24-pound stock

389
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:56,560
as opposed to the 80-pound
favored by most institutions.

390
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:59,446
Watson, I added several tomes
on handwriting analysis

391
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,164
to your reading list
the other week.

392
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,699
If you've properly
absorbed them,

393
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,317
you'll find
the signatures of both

394
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,953
the dean and the board
president most interesting.

395
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:10,373
Ah, Florence Costello
and Martin Faber.

396
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,877
They have the same
D'Nealian capital F's.

397
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:15,795
That's because they were
written by one person

398
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:18,214
attempting to mimic
two different styles.

399
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,783
This certificate from
the Unified Court System

400
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,134
looks a bit dodgy as well.

401
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:22,335
Perhaps I should
give them a call,

402
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:23,837
see if you're
actually licensed.

403
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,805
I know him, okay?

404
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:28,091
I know Charles Milverton.

405
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:29,759
But he's not my client.

406
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:31,978
If anything, you could say
that I was a client of his.

407
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:34,230
Explain.

408
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:36,399
A few years ago,
I got him off

409
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:37,901
a DWI charge.

410
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,853
He said if any
sensitive information

411
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:43,273
came across my desk,
that he could use it

412
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,775
to make some money
for both of us.

413
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:47,627
Just so we're clear--

414
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:49,245
that's all I did.

415
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,497
That's all.

416
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:51,814
Hey, I'm not the one

417
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,085
that was supposed
to disperse materials

418
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,654
if something happened to
Charles-- that was someone else.

419
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,822
You're a liar who lies.

420
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,458
Charles never told me his name,
but I know that he's out there.

421
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,294
Charles used to call
him his fail-safe.

422
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:08,598
We need everything you
have on Milverton.

423
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,350
And I do mean everything.

424
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,168
Lots of evidence

425
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,972
that Duke Landers is even
scummier than we thought,

426
00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:19,192
but nothing helpful
on Milverton's accomplice.

427
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:22,362
How are you doing
with the, um...?

428
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:23,613
Are those sobriety chips?

429
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:25,014
I ordered a set
online yesterday,

430
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,449
had them shipped
overnight.

431
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:28,401
Wanted to see what all
the fuss was about.

432
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:30,537
Colors are a bit garish, no?

433
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,739
More appropriate to a
successful first year

434
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:35,208
as a Vegas showgirl.

435
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,411
Have you been playing
quarters with these?

436
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:39,829
I didn't drink
anything, Watson,

437
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,414
I just wanted to
see them bounce.

438
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,802
I don't believe you.

439
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:47,253
Smell my breath.
I'm not talking about the drinking.

440
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:48,755
I'm talking about
what you said yesterday

441
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:50,501
about me not weighing in
on your sobriety.

442
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:51,342
What?

443
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:53,226
Listen, if you want to talk
about your feelings

444
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:55,895
about your one-year chip,
I'm here.

445
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,384
You were asking if
I'd found anything.

446
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:02,485
The answer is...

447
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:03,937
maybe.

448
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:06,990
Two years ago,

449
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:10,226
Charles Milverton referred
a client to the Sheriff.

450
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,328
His name was Abraham Zelner,

451
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,064
a morbidly obese man who
wanted to sue an airline

452
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,750
for removing him from a flight.

453
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:18,702
Zelner was the only client

454
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,537
Milverton referred.

455
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:22,455
Earlier we were
theorizing that

456
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,207
"HENRY8" was

457
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:25,759
Milverton's accomplice.

458
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,460
Henry the Eighth, as
I'm sure you're aware,

459
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,763
was the fattest monarch
in British history.

460
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,364
So you think Zelner
was his accomplice

461
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,633
and that Milverton
gave him that code name

462
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:35,051
because he was heavyset?

463
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,936
Hmm, Orson Welles
was heavyset.

464
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:39,589
Abraham Zelner could pull
small moons out of orbit.

465
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,194
Captain, what is the first
thing that comes to mind

466
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:46,029
when I say "Henry the Eighth"?

467
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:47,280
Herman's Hermits?

468
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:48,264
Listen.

469
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,699
Call came in a little while ago

470
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:51,735
from a night watchman
at a construction site.

471
00:21:51,737 --> 00:21:54,437
He saw some, uh,
suspicious activity.

472
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,139
The responding officers
found a perp

473
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:59,108
trying to dump a corpse
into some wet cement

474
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,794
in the building's foundation.

475
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:02,245
Victim was

476
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:04,714
shot three times in the chest--
the perp claims

477
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:07,734
he did it
'cause he was being blackmailed.

478
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:10,804
Some hypothetical bells
obviously went off.

479
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:13,473
Was the victim's name,
perchance, Milverton?

480
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,625
First name Charles.

481
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,926
The culprit didn't,
by any chance,

482
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:19,262
confess to being
his accomplice, did he?

483
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:22,398
No, his name is Anthony Pistone.

484
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,485
His daughter is Karen Pistone,
Brent Garvey's second victim.

485
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:28,071
- Yes, he was being blackmailed, too.
- Yeah,

486
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:30,690
and his attorney's already
spinning his story to the media.

487
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:34,994
So I'm afraid the news
that Charles Milverton is dead

488
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:37,497
is officially out.

489
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,529
I got the first
blackmail note...

490
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:53,831
nine months ago.

491
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:57,401
It came with a DVD.

492
00:22:57,403 --> 00:23:01,039
Hearing about it when
it first happened,

493
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,207
that was nothing
compared to seeing it.

494
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:06,511
I swear, if I could have
got my hands on Garvey...

495
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:07,678
Anthony,

496
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,548
let's try to
stay on topic.

497
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,517
I did what
I had to do.

498
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,751
I paid.

499
00:23:13,753 --> 00:23:16,054
It wasn't easy.

500
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:19,273
My brother and I have
a contracting business.

501
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:21,309
Work was slow.

502
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:24,695
But no way was I gonna
let that tape get out.

503
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:27,899
I thought that would
be the end of it.

504
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:30,485
I was wrong.

505
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:32,954
A few weeks later
I get an e-mail.

506
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:35,239
Same threat,
same demand.

507
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:38,076
How did you find
Charles Milverton?

508
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:40,912
He e-mailed me
again last week.

509
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:42,964
Asked for more money.

510
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:46,734
I wrote him back and said
I had it, but it was in cash.

511
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:50,888
Said I'd borrowed it from
a friend who runs numbers.

512
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,225
Couldn't deposit it in a bank
without raising a red flag.

513
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:57,562
I left an envelope
under a park bench.

514
00:23:57,564 --> 00:24:00,264
When he came to pick it
up, I followed him home.

515
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:03,467
A few nights later I broke
in through his back door,

516
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:06,404
shot him.

517
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,973
Grabbed his body and
his laptop and took off.

518
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:11,692
- Where's the laptop now?
- Smashed.

519
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:15,613
I stomped on it and
tossed it in some Dumpster.

520
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:17,615
I understand
there was some postmortem damage

521
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:19,500
done to the victim's face.

522
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:26,591
When your guys
came at me tonight,

523
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:31,328
when I, uh, I realized
I couldn't get away...

524
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,216
I looked down at Milverton,
and it was like

525
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:38,853
he was looking back at me.

526
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:43,441
Like he was laughing.

527
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:44,559
I snapped.

528
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:48,563
Lifted my boot
up and just...

529
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:53,618
He's got enough face left
for an open casket.

530
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,705
It's more than he deserves.

531
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,160
It's the guy you saw
the other night, right?

532
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:03,744
The man I saw
was wearing a mask,

533
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:05,163
but the height
and weight are correct.

534
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:06,881
And usually
I feel so good

535
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:09,533
when we've got a killer dead to rights.
The man is an idiot.

536
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:10,918
He's put all of
Milverton's victims--

537
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,887
including his own
daughter-- at risk.

538
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:16,007
For all we know, Internet is already
flooded with their secrets.

539
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:18,643
I'm not saying
I agree with what he did.

540
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:20,728
I'm saying
I sympathize.

541
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,349
The guy plays his
cards right, the D.A.

542
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:27,602
won't ask for more than
manslaughter in the first;

543
00:25:27,604 --> 00:25:29,080
he'll be out in three
and a half years.

544
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:30,388
Yeah.

545
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:38,279
Holmes. I went to that address
you gave me.

546
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,697
The one for the
guy you thought

547
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:40,915
was working with
the dead blackmailer,

548
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:41,999
Abraham Zelner.

549
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:43,501
Tell me you
have him in custody.

550
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:45,002
The address
wasn't a residence,

551
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:46,537
it was a butcher
shop in Chinatown.

552
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:47,838
It gets worse.

553
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,507
Can't find any
record of the guy

554
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:51,759
in the NCIC or
the DMV database.

555
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:52,869
None.

556
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:54,680
Sorry. I know you
thought it was a lead,

557
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:56,580
but as far as I can
tell, the name's a fake.

558
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,254
The brownstone is on fire,
my bees have escaped

559
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,389
and there is a giant
comet headed for Manhattan.

560
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,258
Excuse me?
The way the evening is going

561
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,593
I thought you could only be
calling with more good news.

562
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,262
I don't know what kind
of news this is,

563
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:12,980
but Alfredo was here
and he thought we should know

564
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:15,432
that his sponsor just got a new
blackmail demand

565
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:17,652
from Charles Milverton.

566
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:21,188
What do you think it means?

567
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,407
Henry Eight.

568
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:25,076
You think his
accomplice sent it?

569
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:27,745
As Milverton's fail-safe,
he would be privy

570
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,047
to all aspects of the operation.

571
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:33,050
He possesses the same prurient
material that Milverton did.

572
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:35,920
But instead of exposing it,
as he was supposed to...

573
00:26:35,922 --> 00:26:38,723
He's using it
to take over the business.

574
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:40,457
Milverton's murder
has been all over

575
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:41,726
the news for hours now.

576
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:45,930
Henry Eight
knows and doesn't care.

577
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:49,466
Hmm. I can't recall the
last time I was so thankful

578
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:51,635
for the essential avarice
of the human condition.

579
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:52,737
You're happy about this?

580
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:55,406
Milverton's plan
has backfired.

581
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:58,526
His fail-safe has shirked the
duties for which he was hired.

582
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:00,911
Which means,
that for the moment, the secrets

583
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:03,164
of Milverton's
blackmail targets are safe.

584
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:05,833
Abraham Zelner, as it turns out,
was a pseudonym,

585
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:07,535
but I still think
that the fat man

586
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:11,155
represented by Duke Landers
is Milverton's accomplice.

587
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:14,158
You're gonna open up
Lander's files again.

588
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,844
Only lead we have
at the moment, so, yes.

589
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:19,764
But not before tea.
It's gonna be a long night.

590
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:21,526
Thank you, Alfredo.
You've been most helpful.

591
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:27,722
Hey.

592
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:31,192
Want to, uh, check in with you
about tomorrow before I go.

593
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,146
We're going to a meeting.

594
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:36,647
You're getting your chip.

595
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,216
Yeah.

596
00:27:39,218 --> 00:27:41,485
About that. Um...

597
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,371
tomorrow's not
really good for me.

598
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:45,823
Well, you're working,
I get it. But...

599
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:47,325
your day is your day, man.

600
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,043
I promise,
it'll only take a few minutes.

601
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:51,495
Look, Alfredo...

602
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:54,531
it's not the case,
it's the chip.

603
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,384
I can't accept it.

604
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:58,535
I know that
to most addicts

605
00:27:58,537 --> 00:28:00,221
it's a treasured token.

606
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:02,506
It's a very tangible
representation of the their

607
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,558
hard work
and determination, but...

608
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,260
I'm not most addicts.

609
00:28:06,262 --> 00:28:09,046
To me it does not commemorate
a period of success,

610
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:12,383
but rather, the end
of a period of great failure.

611
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:16,553
I failed when I abused drugs
and I would really rather not be

612
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:19,573
reminded of that fact.

613
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:24,912
I'm sorry if that's
how you see it.

614
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:34,538
You know what I wish you got?

615
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Milestones like this one...

616
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,927
they're yours,
but they're not about you.

617
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:43,748
They're about all the people who
haven't got there yet.

618
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,884
They see you do it,
and they think why can't I?

619
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:49,520
You know, I
know it's hard,

620
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:55,059
but one of these days,
you got to get over yourself.

621
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,552
I believe I've uncovered the
real identity of Henry Eight.

622
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:08,322
It all starts with the
corpulent Abraham Zelner.

623
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:11,625
It was an assumed
identity used for

624
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:15,396
the expressed purpose of an obesity
discrimination lawsuit.

625
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:17,832
When the airline
that Zelner sued

626
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:21,202
made its first lowball
offer of settlement, he accepted.

627
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:23,554
Probably because he knew
that his false identity

628
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:25,790
would not stand
up to scrutiny.

629
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:26,974
This started
me thinking.

630
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:28,809
What if he'd
done it before?

631
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:32,096
So, you think he sued other airlines?
Airlines,

632
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:33,581
theaters, restaurants.

633
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,933
To the professional fat man,
these businesses

634
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:39,603
are a veritable deep-fried
buffet of nuisance lawsuits.

635
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:41,155
Each one

636
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,640
with a lucrative
stream of income.

637
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:45,993
I dove into the records
of similar lawsuits filed

638
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:47,995
on the East Coast and
focused only on those

639
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:51,582
that resulted in quick
"go away" payoffs.

640
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:54,034
Do you notice anything unusual
about the names

641
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,319
of these plaintiffs?

642
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:57,121
Abraham Zelner,

643
00:29:57,123 --> 00:29:59,990
Brad Yates,
Cory Xavier, Declan Winchell...

644
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,525
The initials

645
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:04,728
A.Zed, B.Y., C.X.,

646
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,664
D.W.
They represent a pattern.

647
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,517
First name starts with an "A"
and moves forward,

648
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,469
the last names starts with "Z"
and moves backward.

649
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,855
I believe they
were all assumed by one man;

650
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:16,673
the same man
that Charles Milverton

651
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:18,857
refers to in his ledger
as Henry Eight.

652
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:21,123
That's great, but it still
doesn't tell us the real name.

653
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:22,113
Nope.

654
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,847
But it did help me
find photographs

655
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:26,367
of the plaintiffs in two
of the nuisance suits.

656
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:29,036
One appeared
in a Queen's newspaper

657
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,405
regarding the complaint
of an Ethan Varner

658
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:34,542
against a tanning salon whose beds
could not accommodate

659
00:30:34,544 --> 00:30:36,126
his prodigious girth.

660
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:39,830
Four years ago, the
rotund Stuart Bloom

661
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,248
sued a cineplex
in Dover, Delaware

662
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,718
for excessively small seats.
He received a $50,000 payoff.

663
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,804
It's the same man.

664
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:49,340
Stuart Bloom does not
match the pattern.

665
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:53,544
Does not. Because I believe
it was his first lawsuit.

666
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:55,346
You think that's his real name?

667
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:58,983
Abraham Zelner may not
have a DMV record,

668
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:03,387
but Stuart Bloom
most certainly does.

669
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:06,223
He lives in Staten Island.

670
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:21,038
Mr. Bloom.

671
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,407
It's so
dark in here.

672
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,972
What is it?

673
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:44,812
It's car litter.

674
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,788
I don't think this
was put down for cats.

675
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,108
I think it was put
down to absorb odors.

676
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,171
Captain Gregson,
meet Stuart Bloom,

677
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:25,537
aka Henry Eight,

678
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:28,156
aka Charles Milverton's
accomplice.

679
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,129
Looks like

680
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:37,132
he's been here about a week.

681
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:40,001
Note the bruise
pattern on his chest.

682
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:44,639
Is that a boot print?

683
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:46,224
Obviously the killer
caught him unaware

684
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:47,509
as he drove his head

685
00:32:47,511 --> 00:32:49,677
beneath the water.

686
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,363
The body was
too immense

687
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:53,782
to remove, so rather
than dismember him,

688
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:57,119
Milverton left behind a decade's
worth of cat litter

689
00:32:57,121 --> 00:32:58,320
to cover the stench

690
00:32:58,322 --> 00:33:00,122
of his
decomposition.

691
00:33:00,124 --> 00:33:03,074
Wait a minute, you
think Milverton did this?

692
00:33:03,076 --> 00:33:04,526
Why not
Anthony Pistone?

693
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,179
He killed Milverton.

694
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:11,333
He would've had motive to kill
Bloom, too, no?

695
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:13,510
The bruise on Bloom's
chest suggests a shoe size

696
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:14,921
between a six and an eight.

697
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:17,923
Milverton was a seven.

698
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,808
Mr. Pistone a 12.

699
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,511
Also the cat litter spread
about all over the place.

700
00:33:22,513 --> 00:33:24,846
It's the same one
that Milverton has in his home.

701
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:26,648
I recognize the scent
quite vividly.

702
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,567
We think if you run
the credit cards,

703
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:30,235
you'll find
that he purchased

704
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:32,437
an unusually large amount
of the stuff a couple weeks ago.

705
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:35,056
Any idea why Milverton would
kill his partner in crime?

706
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:37,725
Bloom wanted a raise?

707
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:40,362
I think the more pressing
question, in my humble opinion,

708
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:42,531
is this:
if Mr. Bloom hasn't taken over

709
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,199
the blackmailing business,
then who has?

710
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:50,338
Well, this is a surprise.

711
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,257
I would've thought
you would've covered

712
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:53,792
this wall with
evidence by now.

713
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,377
I did.
I took it down.

714
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,796
Put it back up again.
Took it down again.

715
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:00,665
Not helpful, I take it.

716
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,101
I've been through it all.
So have you.

717
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:06,754
I need new data to move forward.

718
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:09,757
I will take
another look at it

719
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:12,360
before I go to bed.

720
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:17,115
You were right about the
sobriety chips that I ordered.

721
00:34:19,235 --> 00:34:23,121
I was trying to get a rise.
I was...

722
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:25,790
trying to spark
a conversation.

723
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:39,287
I told Alfredo that I,
I could not accept

724
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:41,690
my one-year chip

725
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:43,792
'cause it would
conjure memories

726
00:34:43,794 --> 00:34:46,828
of a period of failure
in my life.

727
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,446
That's not true.

728
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,018
I cannot accept my one-year chip

729
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,155
on my one-year anniversary
because...

730
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:59,241
it's not my anniversary.

731
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:02,427
Are you saying you relapsed?

732
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:04,329
Mm.

733
00:35:04,331 --> 00:35:08,366
It was a while ago.
It was before I met you.

734
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:11,586
The day after I agreed
to enter into rehab,

735
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:13,221
as a matter of fact.

736
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:17,175
I had realized
that my father was right.

737
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:20,995
I needed to repair myself.

738
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:27,352
So I disposed of my drugs
and destroyed my paraphernalia.

739
00:35:27,354 --> 00:35:31,456
The next day I entered Hemdale.

740
00:35:32,308 --> 00:35:34,359
The day after that...

741
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,144
I got sick.

742
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:39,013
And, uh, yeah, very sick.

743
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:46,187
So I devised a way to leave
without being detected.

744
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,790
I got what I needed...

745
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,526
returned.

746
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:53,828
Yeah.

747
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,916
And that was the last time
I took drugs.

748
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:01,002
Not the day before.

749
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:08,059
Sherlock, I understand
why you're upset,

750
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:11,713
but we're talking about
the difference of one day.

751
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:16,184
It does not change what you did
in the 364 that followed.

752
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:25,243
I decided to stop using drugs,
yes?

753
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:29,914
I decided, me.

754
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:32,117
And then 24 hours later...

755
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,210
It sounds like a mere detail...

756
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:44,262
but I'm a man of details.

757
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:46,715
And-and it, it matters to me.

758
00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:53,304
Now, I know that I need
to tell Alfredo,

759
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:58,443
but it's, uh,
proving difficult.

760
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:03,765
And it just didn't seem right
to tell him before you.

761
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:20,648
Ah.

762
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,550
What is it?

763
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:23,985
Charles Milverton's autopsy
report,

764
00:37:23,987 --> 00:37:25,453
which I would happily consider
new data

765
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:27,546
were it not for the fact
that I was there

766
00:37:27,547 --> 00:37:29,439
when he was gunned down.

767
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:33,511
Hmm.

768
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:36,064
What?

769
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,816
Uh, when you said that

770
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:39,818
Anthony Pistone stomped
on Milverton's face,

771
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,770
I assumed it was all over,

772
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:44,806
but according to this,
there's just damage to one side.

773
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,993
They're gone.

774
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:50,412
What are?

775
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:53,081
His scars.
There was patches of them here.

776
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,250
Very distinctive.

777
00:37:55,252 --> 00:37:58,787
Almost as though Pistone
has targeted them.

778
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:07,512
Mr. Pistone, such a pleasure
to see you again.

779
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:09,464
I was so glad to hear
that you made bail this morning.

780
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,299
Thanks. My attorney said you had

781
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:14,719
some more questions for me
before I go home.

782
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:16,170
Yeah. Remind us,

783
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:19,173
when did you first identify
Charles Milverton

784
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:20,942
as your blackmailer?

785
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:24,229
A few nights ago,
like I told you.

786
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:25,847
We now have reason
to believe

787
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:28,233
that you actually
crossed paths before that.

788
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:31,119
Charles Milverton was savagely
beaten four months ago.

789
00:38:31,121 --> 00:38:33,371
He had to go to an ER.

790
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:35,323
He said he was mugged,
which is why

791
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:37,125
the responding detectives
took photographs,

792
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:38,493
but we think he lied.

793
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:42,547
He gave varying descriptions
of his mugger to the police.

794
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:45,300
The doctor who treated him
chalked that up to concussion,

795
00:38:45,302 --> 00:38:47,719
but we think it was
more than that.

796
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:49,921
We think that he couldn't
tell the real story.

797
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:52,807
Which was that you found him and
beat him until he surprised you

798
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:54,809
with an offer that
you could not refuse:

799
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:56,678
a piece of his
blackmailing business.

800
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,982
See these gashes, left temple?

801
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:03,852
Now these wounds bear
a striking resemblance

802
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:06,070
to the emblem on your ring.

803
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:10,358
Milverton was left
with these scars.

804
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,893
You knew this.

805
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:14,696
So when the police
closed in on you two nights ago,

806
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:17,749
you trampled his face in
a effort to obscure them.

807
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:21,235
You want to guess how many
of these are out there?

808
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:23,254
Mm. It's interesting
that you failed to mention

809
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:25,840
the other night that Karen
is not your daughter,

810
00:39:25,842 --> 00:39:27,342
but your stepdaughter.

811
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:31,346
According to your neighbors,
you two fight a lot.

812
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:33,915
You found Milverton
months ago.

813
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,751
You intended to punish him,
but he offered you

814
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:39,554
a piece of his operation
in exchange for his life.

815
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:41,422
You needed the money.

816
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:43,558
You took him up
on his offer.

817
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,311
Charles now had
two partners:

818
00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:48,196
his fail-safe
Stuart Bloom and you.

819
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:49,948
Someone had to go.

820
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,901
Milverton murdered Bloom.
Maybe you put him up to it,

821
00:39:52,903 --> 00:39:55,102
maybe he did it
of his own volition.

822
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:57,104
Either way, I suspect

823
00:39:57,106 --> 00:40:00,124
a fifty-fifty split wasn't
enough for you.

824
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:03,110
These are theories, Captain.
You're gonna need proof.

825
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:06,497
I agree. Which is why we
conducted a thorough search

826
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:09,884
of your client's business
and home this morning.

827
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:14,255
We found this laptop

828
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:16,057
at his office.

829
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:17,809
It's Milverton's.

830
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:20,628
You told me you smashed it.
Threw it in a Dumpster.

831
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,814
Funny thing is
we didn't find it

832
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:25,099
in your desk,
but in your brother's.

833
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:27,101
He's already confessed
to being your partner,

834
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:31,406
the Stuart Bloom to
your Charles Milverton.

835
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:33,074
He was the one who
sent Ken Whitman

836
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:34,525
the new demand
for money when

837
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:36,444
you were in police custody
the other day.

838
00:40:36,446 --> 00:40:38,980
So it looks like
you'll be spending

839
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:42,166
a few more decades in prison
than you thought.

840
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:48,957
Hey.

841
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:50,825
Change your mind?

842
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:53,294
I have not.

843
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:56,598
What are you doing here?

844
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,666
You okay?

845
00:40:58,668 --> 00:41:02,720
There's something I'd like
to discuss with you.

846
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:10,511
Hey. I didn't hear
you come in.

847
00:41:10,513 --> 00:41:12,864
You know me,
stealthy as a shadow.

848
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:15,900
How'd it go
with Alfredo?

849
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,353
Liberating.

850
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:21,072
As you predicted.

851
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,908
I'm lucky to have him.

852
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:28,997
Look at the time.

853
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:30,999
Happy real anniversary.

854
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:37,338
Regardless of the actual start
date of my sobriety,

855
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,373
I still have no interest
in public celebrations,

856
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:44,896
speeches, encouragements
or the bestowing of chips.

857
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:46,431
I know.

858
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:51,519
I saw this in a
secondhand store.

859
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:54,155
It's dark.

860
00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:58,076
It's not just for anyone,
but I thought it was very you.

861
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,165
I just wanted to let you know
that I was thinking of you.
