approximately ten days ago.

You were his teaching
assistant, correct?

100

For the last four years.

101
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:17,395
His wife told us he had
to work late last night.

102
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,947
Something about
a department meeting.

103
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,432
He left here after his last
class got out at 5:30.

104
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,601
If there were a meeting,
I would've heard about it.

105
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,570
Think maybe he lied
his wife?

106
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,739
Or she lied to us?

107
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:47,308
Professor Annunzio was chair
of the department.

108
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,477
May I assume
that he had his pick

109
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,264
of the offices
on this floor?

110
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,485
Hmm. It's interesting.

00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,105
I'll be out here
if you need anything.

112
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:05,110
Sort of cramped for a
department chair, huh?

Appointment book.

114
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:09,531
Maybe it'll tell us what
he got up to last night.

115
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,282
Unlikely he would
notate trips

116
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,535
to an underground Chinese
gambling parlor.

117
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:14,869
Excuse me?

118
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,454
That's what he was
doing last night.

119
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,706
I know you're
just waiting for me

120
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,126
to ask you why
you think that.

121
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:22,794
Why do you think that?

122
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,797
I'm glad you asked.
It was the thirteens.

123
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,883
His apartment was 13, his cell
phone number ends in 1313,

124
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:30,802
and he chose this office,
number 13,

125
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:33,438
when he could have had the
far brighter and more spacious

126
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,356
office across
the way, number 14.

127
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:37,609
Why? Because 14
is an unlucky number

128
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:39,010
in Chinese gambling.

129
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:40,979
13, quite the opposite.

130
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,330
Annunzio spoke fluent Mandarin.

131
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:44,432
Surely he could talk
his way into the mahjong

132
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,067
or Pai Gow parlors in Chinatown.

133
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,569
Maybe he's
a gambler.

134
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,205
Doesn't mean
he was gambling last night.

135
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:53,575
Did you not notice
his underwear earlier?

136
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,977
Bright red boxers, hmm?

137
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,497
Customary for Chinese gamblers
to wear red for good luck.

138
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,916
His clothes reeked
of cigarettes,

139
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,220
but his teeth were bright white,
not smoker-yellow.

140
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:08,306
He was gambling, and he was
gambling in a smoky room.

141
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:10,675
Starting to think
you're right.

142
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,310
Mahjong tiles.

143
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:16,064
Those are different sizes,
they're different colors.

144
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,099
They're clearly
from different sets.

145
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,684
Now, mahjong tiles
come in pairs.

146
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,352
Why would he hold
onto one of each?

147
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:24,489
Because these tiles
aren't for playing.

148
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:26,991
They're membership cards
to underground casinos.

149
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:29,494
Aren't you gonna ask me
how I knew that?

150
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,448
Fine. Whatever.

151
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,733
When I worked Vice,
poker clubs would give out

152
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:38,286
personalized chips
to repeat customers

153
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,121
to reward loyalty
and weed out cops.

154
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,790
Show these,
skip the line.

155
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,926
Chinatown Vice can tell us

156
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:47,095
which parlors use
which tiles.

157
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:49,914
Wow, you, you look
incredible.

158
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,633
Yeah, well, you look terrible.

159

162
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,557
What do you want, Liam?

163
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,425
I need your help.

164
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,311
If by "help" you mean bail...

165
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:05,396
I don't.

166
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,298
You want to tell me
what you did?

167
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,050
According to the cops?

168
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,401
Hit-and-run.
Oh...

169
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,103
I don't think that
I did it, okay?

170
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,621
What do you mean,
you don't think that you did it?

171
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,957
I partied a couple nights
ago, I passed out.

172
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,442
I wake up in the morning,
there's these two cops

173
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,495
banging on my door, saying
that I ran a red light

174
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:22,330
at 2:00 in the morning,

175
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:25,250
I clipped some lady's car
and sent her to the hospital.

176
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,221
Why'd they think it was you?
Because

177
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,674
somebody got a picture
of my car speeding away

178
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:34,726
and got the license plate
and everything.

179
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:36,811
It wasn't me, okay?
Joanie, you know how bad

180
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,396
I've always been
with my keys.

181
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,315
I probably left them in the car.

182
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,100
Somebody saw it,
took it for a joyride...

183
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:43,901
Liam!
Look, I think I would've remembered

184
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,104
clipping someone else's car.

185
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,522
Not if you were blacked out,
you wouldn't.

186
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:48,940
Listen, all I'm asking is

187
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:51,743
if you could just
put in a good word

188
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:54,746
with your friend, you know,
the one at the D.A.'s office.

189
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,981
You know what?

190
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,033
I know this isn't what
you want to hear,

191
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:02,954
but I can't do it.
I can't help you anymore.

192
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:05,540
I can't.

193
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,375
You treat all the guys
you slept with

194
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:09,460
this nice, or
is it just me?

195
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:11,879
Just you.

196
00:09:15,184 --> 00:09:18,052
Oh, good,
you're here.

197
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:19,604
You can deal
with him.

198
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,139
Everything okay?

199
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:23,124
Spent the entire
car ride yammering

200
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,692
into a digital recorder.

201
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,110
Something about
the effect on tides

202
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:27,612
on crime rates
in New York.

203
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,364
I'm considering writing
a monograph.

204
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,032
You should check
his fever.

205
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:32,533
I think he's
hallucinating.

206
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:34,569
How was your visit
to the penal colony?

207
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:36,104
You sort your old client out?

208
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,906
Well, private
information.

209
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:41,859
Huh. Well, Detective Bell
has managed to acquire

210
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,695
the addresses of three different
gambling parlors.

211
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:47,048
We determined
Trent Annunzio was not

212
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,683
in the first two
last night,

213
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:51,169
so I'd say
you're just in time.

214
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,510
NYPD.

215
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:00,978
Can we come in?

216
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,855
Can I help...
with your old client?

217
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:13,107
It's obvious his predicament
is distracting you.

218
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:15,193
He isn't your problem.

219
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:19,030
No. But he and I are members
of a very exclusive club,

220
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,899
the sober clients
of Joan Watson.

221
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,618
Brothers, in a sense.

222
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,287
Is there any chance
he's innocent?

223
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,039
He's not.

224
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:35,913
You in charge here?

225
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:40,918
Guys, who here
speaks English?

226
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,054
Did he tell you
he was not innocent?

227
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:44,922
He shot up
a few nights ago,

228
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:46,590
hit a woman
with his car.

229
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,226
He doesn't remember
because he blacked out.

230
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:49,527
But not remembering
something

231
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,612
doesn't mean you
didn't do it.

232
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,147
Nor does it mean
you did do it.

233
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,116
This client crossed
some boundaries.

234
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:58,286
Abused my good faith on
more than one occasion.

235
00:10:58,288 --> 00:10:59,937
If this is how
he bottoms out,

236
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,823
I have to let
it happen.

237
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:04,108
No one here speaks English.

238
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,445
No, Detective,
I don't believe that's true.

239
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:10,798
You. Uh, you recently applied
bleach to this section

240
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,784
of the floor,
did you not?

241
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,219
We both know that you understand
me, just like we both know

242
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:16,504
that you're not the janitor.

243
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:17,922
You may have put that apron on,

244
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,724
but you're still wearing
Bespoke Italian shoes.

245
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:21,225
I think you own
this place,

246
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,510
and if you do,

247
00:11:22,512 --> 00:11:24,178
you need to communicate
with suppliers, vendors.

248
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,963
You speak English.

249
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:28,182
So...
you recently applied bleach

250
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:31,235
to this section of the floor and
this section of the floor only.

251
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,803
I would like to know why.

252
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,162
We had a drunk in the club.

253
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:44,115
He threw up there.

254
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,200
On an area this large?

255
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:50,004
And with such force
you had to spackle the wall?

256
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,039
I suggest you either
stop serving

257
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,008
that particular cocktail
or you just admit

258
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,093
that you had a shooting
in here, and you dug

259
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,546
two slugs out of the wall.

260
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:02,383
Fine, let's let
the video decide.

261
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:03,468
What video?

262
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,636
The one you recorded

263
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:07,338
on that.

264
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,639
Um,

265
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:11,142
Holmes, that's a smoke detector.

266
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:12,610
Positioned directly
over a hibachi grill?

267
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:14,028
I don't think so.

268
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,613
That is a security
camera designed

269
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,565
to look like
a smoke detector.

270
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,866
I subscribe to several personal
security catalogs

271
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,401
and I recognize the make
and the model,

272
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:21,903
so...

273
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:24,622
Would you like to take it
from here, Detective?

274
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,157
Show us the footage
or you'll never

275
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,126
deal another hand
in this place.

276
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,195
Go get my computer.

277
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,249
There's our man.

278
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,868
And there's the man
who shot our man.

279
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,055
Perp pulls a gun
on the bouncer, pushes in.

280
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:42,340
"Give me all
your wallets

281
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:43,641
or I'll shoot
your head off""

282
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:46,177
No surprise, most do.

283
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,212
Save Professor Annunzio.

284
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,815
Mm, he's frozen up.

285
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,316
You might not want
to watch this part.

286
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,238
I take it we have you
or your people to thank

287
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,323
for dumping him
under the Manhattan Bridge?

288
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,826
Hey, we were
victims, too.

289
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,244
I'd like to see
the other video--

290
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:05,563
the one where you see
the gunman's face.

291
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,081
What other video?

292
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,417
Well, the hallway we came down
was a good 80 feet.

293
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,335
If the gunman had come in
wearing a mask,

294
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,788
the bouncer would've had more
than enough time to subdue him,

295
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,423
or sound an alarm.

296
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:16,757
But the commotion didn't start

297
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,376
until the gunman
entered the club.

298
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:21,128
He must've come down
the hallway, barefaced,

299
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,097
and then pulled the gun.

300
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:25,216
Yes, I know, you prefer
to keep his face to yourself.

301
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,018
You probably have your
colleagues searching

302
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,419
for him as we speak.

303
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,104
You find him first,
you get your money back,

304
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:32,473
and you get to exact whatever
punishment you see fit.

305
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:35,643
Blah, blah, blah--
the video, please.

306
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:43,484
Detective Bell, I give you
Trent Annunzio's murderer.

307
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:04,923
Uh, maybe it's me,
but to look at mug shots,

308
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,125
don't you have to take time
to actually look at them?

309
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:08,676
I am taking time.

310
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:11,012
In each case, I'm taking
exactly the right amount

311
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:14,516
to confirm that none of these
men killed Trent Annunzio.

312
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:19,270
Ugh, what-what is that?
I asked for coffee.

313
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,272
Well, you asked for
coffee, but you got tea.

314
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:24,025
No, I'm British--
this is not tea.

315
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:26,561
There's some traditional
Chinese herbs in there.

316
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,363
I poked around the stalls
in Chinatown

317
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,115
while I was waiting for you.

318
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,599
I found the ingredients
for the same tea

319
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,101
my mom used to make me
when I was sick.

320
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:34,702
Well, all due respect
to your mother,

321
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:37,839
I would prefer something proven
by a scientific method.

322
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,541
The herbs in that tea have been
proven scientifically

323
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,176
to inhibit the movement
of neutrophils,

324
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,078
improve the function
of protective cilia,

325
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,629
and contribute
to longer-lasting,

326
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:46,998
more vasodilated erections.

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,383
By your mother?

328
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:50,218
Just shut up and drink it.

329
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,723
What is that?

330
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,258
That's the arrest report
from your former client,

331
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,643
Liam Danow.

332
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:00,745
I didn't tell
you his name.

333
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:02,480
You told me his crime, date
of arrest, sex of his victim.

334
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:05,016
Consciously or not, you knew
I could put that together.

335
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,968
I said I didn't want your help.

336
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,686
Well, I haven't given it
to you yet.

337
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,855
I haven't even cracked
the spine.

338
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:14,492
I just thought you might want
all the facts at your disposal.

339
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:15,777
What for?

340
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:16,978
Well, it's rather difficult

341
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,613
to give up
on someone completely.

342
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:20,665
Harder if you are
a professional

343
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,201
addiction counselor
I would imagine.

344
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:26,254
I just thought
you'd want to be sure.

345
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,639
Hey.

346
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,674
I finally found something
in the photo system.

347
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,376
Raul Ramirez.

348
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:33,845
Served stretches in Sing Sing
for rape and armed robbery.

349
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:35,496
ESU and a couple of our
guys are heading over

350
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:38,383
to his place in
Bushwick right now.

351
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,276
This picture...

352
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:50,445
...doesn't look good

353
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:51,663
for you, Raul.

354
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:56,985
These are the wallets you stole
from the mahjong parlor.

355
00:15:56,987 --> 00:16:00,288
We found them in your garbage.

356
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,373
Oh, and of course,

357
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,627
there's this--
Trent Annunzio's wallet,

358
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:09,214
covered in his dried blood.

359
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:10,915
Hook, line,

360
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:13,418
sinker.

361
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:19,807
What if I give somebody up
to you guys?

362
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:22,060
Get some sort of

363
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:24,145
a special consideration
or something?

364
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,814
Well, I guess that depends.

365
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,850
Who you talking about?

366
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,735
Guy who hired me.

367
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:33,354
You were hired
to do what you did?

368
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:39,360
Look, I get home one night
last week, okay?

369
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:42,063
There's an envelope pushed
under my door.

370
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:43,331
I look inside.

371
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,000
It's a thousand dollars
in cash.

372
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,502
All of a sudden,
my phone rings.

373
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:49,737
Guy on the
other end says

374
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,339
he knows me
from the neighborhood.

375
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,875
Says he knows
about my rap sheet, everything.

376
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:56,711
Says he's got
another nine grand for me...

377
00:16:56,713 --> 00:16:58,546
If you kill Trent Annunzio.

378
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,049
Not just kill him.

379
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:04,135
Shoot him once in each eye.

380
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,888
Did he say why he wanted him
shot in the eyes?

381
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,175
Supposed to shoot him
tomorrow night

382
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:13,278
when he walked to his car
from his office.

383
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,447
Thing is-- been trailing him
the past few days.

384
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,866
Followed him into
that gambling parlor.

385
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,935
Saw it was fat with cash.

386
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:24,656
Figured if I saw him
go in there again...

387
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:26,491
two birds with one stone.

388
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:29,160
Did you ever meet
with this guy?

389
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:32,297
He always just
called or texted.

390
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,783
His voice was real scrambled up
on the phone, too.

391
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,337
Check my cell phone...

392
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:41,506
you'll see the pictures
he sent me.

393
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:43,958
Ramirez's story
checks out so far.

394
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,977
Someone texted him
that two days ago.

395
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,096
Told him where
Annunzio parked, too.

396
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:51,733
I'm guessing the guy who hired
him used a disposable cell?

397
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,418
Yeah, prepaid burner.

398
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,436
Only calls incoming or
outgoing were to Ramirez.

399
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:57,822
Okay, if this isn't random,

400
00:17:57,824 --> 00:18:00,358
who had it in
for this guy Annunzio?

401
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:04,579
If it was the person
who took this picture,

402
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:06,331
then it was a friend.

403
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,166
Or a family member, maybe?

404
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:09,867
Hmm.
What?

405
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:11,836
Um, no, it's just that

406
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,487
the bottom left of this photo,

407
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:17,091
there's discoloration,
there's a rectangle

408
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,294
where it's lighter.

409
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:23,381
I must be sicker
than I thought.

410
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:24,882
I don't know how
I missed that.

411
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:27,552
Um, this is a reflection
of a window

412
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:29,137
judging by the shape of it,

413
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:33,358
which means this is
a photograph of a photograph.

414
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,143
The original was under glass.

415
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,028
The frame cropped out.

416
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,980
Well, there are a lot
of framed photos at the house.

417
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,865
This wasn't taken
at the house.

418
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,150
See this shape?

419
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:44,518
Circle with a square inside it?

420
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,705
That's a Chinese good luck
charm that Annunzio kept

421
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:51,743
in the window of his office.

422
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:53,628
So...

423
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,381
if Ramirez is
telling the truth,

424
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,082
all we got to do
is find someone

425
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:59,550
that access
to Annunzio's office

426
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:04,038
and lives in Raul Ramirez's
neighborhood.

427
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,141
I know someone who fits
that particular bill.

428
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,060
This is ridiculous.

429
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:12,063
I-I've never heard
of Raul Ramirez.

430
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,714
He lives
two blocks away.

431
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:15,650
Same block as
your gym actually.

432
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:17,352
How do you know
where I go to the gym?

433
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:18,569
Your key chain.

434
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,821
Noticed it earlier

435
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,023
when you let us into
Annunzio's office.

436
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,391
Might not have remembered it

437
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:25,610
were it not for that
hideous aquamarine hue.

438
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,528
Do you know how
many people live here?

439
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,163
Not that many
who blamed Trent Annunzio

440
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,499
for destroying
their career.

441
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:32,667
We know that
you applied for

442
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:34,452
a full-time job
at Berkeley.

443
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:36,537
Three week back, we know
that Annunzio sent a letter

444
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,122
to the head of the department.

445
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:41,376
"While Mr. O'Brien does exhibit
a kind of Horatio Alger

446
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:45,096
"can-do spirit, the sad truth
is his work is simply

447
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,264
"never developed.

448
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:48,683
I can not in good conscience
recommend him."

449
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:51,969
How many years did you work
as Annunzio's T.A.?

450
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,355
Four, and...

451
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,974
I wasn't happy he sandbagged me,

452
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,193
obviously, but...

453
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:01,028
I didn't kill him.

454
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,030
We found a draft on his
computer, a letter

455
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,532
of complaint he started writing
a few days ago

456
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:05,983
to campus security.

457
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,652
You threatened to "make him pa""

458
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:09,070
when you heard about the letter.

459
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:11,072
This is Kafka-esque.

460
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:12,573
We're academics.

461
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:14,608
We write nasty letters
to the Paris Review

462
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,210
when we get mad
at each other.

463
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:18,079
We don't hire hit men.

464
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:20,748
Detective?

465
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:24,335
There's pink
in your cheeks.

466
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:26,954
You don't look clammy anymore.

467
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:28,973
I haven't taken your temperature
or anything,

468
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,291
but to the naked eye,
you look better.

469
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:31,759
Well, I feel better.

470
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:34,345
Must've been a weaker
flu than I thought.

471
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,848
Or the tea is working.

472
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:42,320
Got a burner phone.

473
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:44,689
Mr. O'Brien,

474
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:47,859
how do you think
Kafka would explain this?

475
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,861
I've never seen that before.

476
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:51,696
Really? Because we found it
under your bed.

477
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:53,948
And it's only ever
dialed one phone number,

478
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,333
Raul Ramirez.

479
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:57,118
This ties
you to Raul.

480
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,336
Excuse me, Captain?

481
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:01,789
This doesn't
look good.

482
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,040
Whatever it is,
can it wait?

483
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,292
The guy's about
to confess.

484
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:05,877
I-I seriously doubt that.

485
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:07,462
I'm starting to think
if he had anything at all

486
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:09,764
to do with Annunzio's death.

487
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:12,550
We just found the phone that
he used to contact Ramirez.

488
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:13,885
Yes, but isn't the whole
point of a burner phone

489
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:15,470
to "burn" it
after you've used it?

490
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:16,771
Why's he gonna hold on to it?

491
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:19,056
Because he still needed
to reach Ramirez.

492
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:21,275
Because he's an idiot--
you're overthinking this.

493
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,311
Not everyone's
a criminal mastermind.

494
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:24,678
Yes, true, but even so,

495
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,031
he exhibited absolutely
no signs of distress

496
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,066
when your men went
to search his bedroom, hmm?

497
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:31,869
Now, even if he were stupid
enough to hold onto the phone,

498
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:35,206
would he be stupid enough
to forget that he'd done so?

499
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,874
I don't know what you two
are talking about,

500
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,376
but you just missed the show.

501
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:40,244
O'Brien just confessed
to everything.

502
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,998
Thank God
for stupid people.

503
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,150
This would be on the 12th.

504
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,446
Yes, that's right,
I contacted him on the 12th.

505
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,345
And you told him
where he could find Trent Annunzio?

506
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,238
Yeah, I told him
where he could find Trent...

507
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:03,204
You're still
watching this?

508
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:04,806
It isn't right.

509
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:06,491
He's giving
no corroborative detail.

510
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,042
He's just rephrasing
the questions he's asked

511
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:10,595
in the form of statements.

512
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,714
Mr. O'Brien, did you first
attempt to construct

513
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,716
a massive robot
to kill Trent Annunzio?

514
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:17,218
Yes, I first attempted
to construct a massive robot

515
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,502
to kill Trent Annunzio.

516
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,937
You still don't think
he did it?

517
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,941
Not sure.

518
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,845
What's all this?

519
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,816
These are Mr. O'Brien's
bank statements, some mail.

520
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,901
Anything and everything
that Captain Gregson would

521
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:35,403
give me access to
before I left

522
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:36,854
the station this evening.

523
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,523
I was hoping that it would
give me more insight

524
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,992
into the man,
but so far...

525
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:45,163
Well, he certainly downloaded
a lot of music.

526
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,915
Over a hundred songs
last month alone.

527
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,834
Almost exclusively bad.

528
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,303
"My Heart Will Go On""

529
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:54,806
I have a good mind
to let him rot.

530
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:04,265
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you about Liam.

531
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,401
My brother in track-marked arms?

532
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:08,436
Yeah. I took the file
that you dug up,

533
00:23:08,438 --> 00:23:10,238
the one with the details
of his arrest.

534
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:16,727
That's Liam's.

535
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,364
The damage would suggest
a pretty major collision,

536
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,315
but when I saw him, he didn't
have a scratch on him.

537
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,284
Now, if he'd been wearing
a seat belt,

538
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:25,119
I would have seen belt burn
on his neck and chest.

539
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:27,255
If he hadn't been
wearing one,

540
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:29,173
he would had a contusion
where his head hit

541
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,541
the windshield
or steering wheel.

542
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,176
He lives in Astoria.

543
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,295
There have been
a series of joyrides there.

544
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:36,381
The thief abandons
the car afterwards,

545
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:38,416
but strips and pawns
anything of value.

546
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,585
The problem is, all of the cars
the joyrider stole

547
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,554
were hotwired, Liam's was not.

548
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,023
It says here the keys
were found in the ignition.

549
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,726
He said he sometimes
left them in the car.

550
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:51,529
Another discrepancy; nothing
was stripped or stolen.

551
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:55,066
You know what?

552
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:56,901
I gave Liam a Christmas present
one year.

553
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,937
It was a silver key chain
pendant with a watch built in.

554
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,605
You think something was stolen
after all?

555
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,941
It looked expensive,
but it wasn't.

556
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,110
Maybe the guy who stole the car
couldn't tell the difference.

557
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,879
I would be remiss
if I didn't point out

558
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,613
that Liam may have pawned it
himself.

559
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,950
We addicts are, as you know,
not a sentimental lot.

560
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,669
Can I ask you
something?

561
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:16,220
How long were you working
with Liam

562
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,956
before you started sleeping
with him?

563
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:22,126
Your disappointment in him

564
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,728
the other day seemed
a little... extreme.

565
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,596
Especially for an
addiction specialist who has

566
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,849
no doubt seen clients fall off
the wagon before.

567
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:29,734
And now to note the absence
of a trifle

568
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,652
that you gave him
years ago...

569
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:33,354
No judgment.

570
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:35,473
Just curiosity.

571
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,308
I'm heading to Rikers
first thing tomorrow.

572
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,527
You okay without me
for a few hours?

573
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,877
I'm sorry, but I am confused.

574
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:58,012
You think that

575
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:00,381
Mr. O'Brien and I
were having an affair?

576
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,599
These mix CDs,

577
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,267
the ones with your
name on them--

578
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,853
I realized last night
that they were made

579
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:09,307
entirely from songs
purchased by Mr. O'Brien

580
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,641
over the last few months.

581
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,893
Almost entirely

582
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:14,178
from love songs.

583
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,199
Not the grandest
of romantic gestures,

584
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,518
but still, it's not like
he could afford

585
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,404
expensive jewelry for you,
not on a T.A.'s salary.

586
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:24,956
You should have
seen his face

587
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,023
when the police found the phone

588
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,241
that connected him
to Trent's murder.

589
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:29,126
He was stunned.

590
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,028
Probably because he had no idea

591
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,215
that the phone
was in his home. Hmm?

592
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,885
You put it there, didn't you?

593
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:40,087
I don't know
anything about a phone.

594
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:42,056
There's one thing
that still puzzles me,

595
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:44,559
is why he confessed.

596
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,060
I've been racking my brain.

597
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,813
I can only come up with
two possible answers.

598
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,982
One, he thought you
left it there by mistake

599
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:53,050
after a tryst, and
you were planning

600
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,153
to go back, retrieve it,
dispose of it,

601
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,073
having no idea that the police
would recover it first.

602
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,909
Two, he's the ultimate sap.

603
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:04,078
He realized that
you set him up,

604
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,831
but he loves you so much,

605
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,666
he thought he'd just take
the fall anyway.

606
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,869
Either way, he comes
off looking a bit dim.

607
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:15,573
Please, I'd like you
to leave now.

608
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,708
If you have something
to tell us,

609
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,343
the sooner, the better.

610
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:22,179
Not just for Brendan O'Brien,
but for you.

611
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:31,055
This is an old manual given
to Chinese political police.

612
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,108
It teaches how
to beat a suspect,

613
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,594
but leave no marks.

614
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:41,098
He used these
techniques to hurt me.

615
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,436
And he also made
me do things.

616
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:49,323
Sex things, horrible things
while he taped them.

617
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,742
Let's say we believe you,
Mrs. Annunzio.

618
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,412
That doesn't justify murder.

619
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:56,581
I had nothing to do
with Trent's death.

620
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,749
I don't believe Brendan
did either.

621
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:01,619
I... I can't explain
how the phone that was used

622
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,455
to contact Trent's killer
got into Brendan's apartment,

623
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,258
but I do know he would
never take a life.

624
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,678
Respectfully, Mrs. Annunzio,
you've just told us

625
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,631
that your husband was a sadist
and a pervert.

626
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,566
Assuming that's true,

627
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:18,352
why would we trust
your judgment?

628
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,406
Trent was not my husband.

629
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,191
He promised to marry
me when he asked me

630
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:26,944
to come to America
with him several years ago.

631
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:31,982
But then when we arrived here,
he went back on that promise.

632
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,835
He knew I could
not go to the police

633
00:27:34,837 --> 00:27:36,337
without revealing my status.

634
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:38,322
I could be deported.

635
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,125
And when did Brendan
come into the picture?

636
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:46,547
He came to the house one day
to leave something for Trent.

637
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:51,502
And he found me crying...

638
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,170
and he held me.

639
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,641
And when the time was right,
I was going to leave Trent,

640
00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:59,360
and Brendan and I
were going to marry.

641
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:02,697
You told us that, um,
you lied to us the other day,

642
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:06,117
so why should
we believe you now?

643
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,170
The... the videos he made of me.

644
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:11,739
He kept them all on
this computer.

645
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,077
There's even one in
which he beat me.

646
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:23,217
They were, they were all here!

647
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:24,835
Mrs. Annunzio, I think it's time

648
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,754
we took this back
to the station.

649
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,377
I don't really get it.

650
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,680
What exactly am
I supposed to be looking for?

651
00:28:35,682 --> 00:28:37,314
Anything out
of the ordinary.

652
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,223
I'm sorry about what I said
to you the other day.

653
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,858
About you not treating me right.

654
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,861
It's fine.
No, it's not fine.

655
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:53,926
When I think about some of the
things that I did, I just...

656
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:55,155
It makes you crazy.

657
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
There are nights
you wake up crying.

658
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:59,086
You wish you had
it all to do

659
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,571
over again, you'd do it
differently.

660
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,339
We've had this conversation
before.

661
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,075
You've apologized to me before.

662
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,962
I know you feel sorry, because
if you didn't, why say it?

663
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:11,081
What I've never understood
is why you don't put yourself

664
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,851
in a position to stop
apologizing to people.

665
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:26,397
The key chain pendant,
the one you gave me

666
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,983
that year for Christmas,
it's not here.

667
00:29:28,985 --> 00:29:32,153
You're sure?

668
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:35,322
Yeah, I'm sure.

669
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,298
Watson...

670
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,117
how was your day?

671
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,753
Whose computer is that?

672
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:49,970
It's Trent Annunzio's.

673
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,756
Borrowing it.

674
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,257
Why?

675
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,292
Because...

676
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,678
I strongly suspect that
it may once have contained

677
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,681
evidence that would prove
Annunzio abused his wife.

678
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:03,317
I thought the hard drive
may have been swapped out,

679
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,187
but that doesn't appear
to be the case.

680
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:09,440
You said this morning
that she was the one

681
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:12,660
who hired Raul Ramirez
to kill him.

682
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:14,361
I did.

683
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:17,314
Then why are you looking for
evidence to help her?

684
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,951
Because, upon further
examination of the facts,

685
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,671
I now have reason to believe
that I was wrong,

686
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:26,990
and that in accusing her, I may
have inadvertently positioned

687
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,760
the United Stated Immigration
and Customs Enforcement Agency

688
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:32,630
to separate an innocent woman
from her infant daughter

689
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,499
on a very permanent basis.

690
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,856
That tea that you made
the other day,

691
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:44,391
could you make some more of it?

692
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,814
I keep asking myself,

693
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:52,066
why would she tell us about
her husband's brutality

694
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:53,484
if she wasn't absolutely certain

695
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:55,236
that she could show
us some proof?

696
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:57,505
You think someone
wiped his computer for him?

697
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,523
It's hard to say.

698
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,709
I haven't exactly been
at my best lately.

699
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:02,877
Well, you were right

700
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:04,628
about Liam--
that pendant I gave him,

701
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,380
it was stolen.
He told me this morning.

702
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:09,166
I spent the rest of the day visiting
pawnshops in Queens

703
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,534
until I found it.

704
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,003
The owner knew the kid
who brought it in,

705
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,756
so once the police find him,
they're gonna let Liam go.

706
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:18,976
Mm. Well done, Watson.

707
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:22,396
Perhaps you should take the
reins on the Annunzio case.

708
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,104
I didn't tell you
the whole story.

709
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:32,106
Liam's not an ex-client.

710
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,458
He's just... an ex.

711
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,230
You were romantically involved;
you just weren't his companion.

712
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,449
I met him
on an ER rotation

713
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,251
back when I was
still a resident.

714
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:47,121
Some lady got her purse snatched
in front of him.

715
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:48,756
He tackled the guy,
the guy smashed his skull

716
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:50,474
with a bottle and ran off.

717
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,593
I gave him 39 stitches.

718
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,879
Was he already using?

719
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:58,249
No.

720
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,467
No, that came later.

721
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,923
I hosted an intervention,
I drove him to rehab.

722
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,309
He was better when he came out,

723
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:10,110
but only for a little while.

724
00:32:10,112 --> 00:32:14,248
Everything that followed
is typically what follows.

725
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,100
A lot of lies,

726
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,819
heartbreak.

727
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,537
Anyway, the upside was that

728
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:24,107
I learned a lot about how
to deal with people like him.

729
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,076
So when I left medicine,

730
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,746
companionship seemed like
a pretty natural fit.

731
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,802
Hmm.

732
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:37,421
It's the autopsy report
on Trent Annunzio.

733
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,390
The ME found dried
chrysanthemum

734
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:41,158
and mulberry leaf in
his stomach contents.

735
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,426
Oh, those are both...

736
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:44,461
Medicinal Chinese herbs.
Yes, well aware.

737
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,965
This particular combination
is used to treat eye pain.

738
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,132
How did you know that?

739
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,318
I may have done some research
into the efficacy

740
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,270
of Chinese medicine
after the herbs that you gave me

741
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,639
had a positive correlation
with my recovery.

742
00:32:55,641 --> 00:33:00,310
Anyway, point is, this could
hardly be a coincidence.

743
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,615
He was shot in both eyes while
self-medicating for eye pain.

744
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:08,318
I noticed something
back at his apartment.

745
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,921
There was a photograph of him
and his students.

746
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:13,791
Everyone in it had, um,

747
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:16,326
red eye from the camera flash
except for him.

748
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,495
I didn't give it much thought,
but it's possible

749
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,998
that something was blocking
his tapetum lucidum.

750
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,383
The reflective part
of the retina.

751
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:23,717
Such as?

752
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:26,169
Best guess would be a melanoma.

753
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,089
We need to get
to the coroner's office.

754
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:32,860
I think I know who arranged
Trent Annunzio's murder.

755
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:35,112
You want to tell me
what I'm looking at?

756
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,647
Melanoma cells.

757
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:37,982
The medical examiner

758
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:39,900
found them a short while
ago in what was left

759
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:42,352
of Trent Annunzio's eye sockets.

760
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,737
He had cancer?

761
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:45,572
Not just any cancer.

762
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:47,574
Uveal melanoma.

763
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:50,661
It's as painful
as it is untreatable.

764
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,880
It's likely he only had
a few months to live.

765
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:54,465
I'm confused.

766
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,000
I thought you said
on the phone

767
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:57,868
you knew who
killed Annunzio.

768
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,202
I do.

769
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,088
Annunzio.

770
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,676
Imagine for a moment that, um...

771
00:34:05,678 --> 00:34:08,645
he was exactly the man
his wife said he was.

772
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,315
He tortured her, physically,
psychologically.

773
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,600
Forced her to perform
sexual acts

774
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:15,019
in front of a camera.

775
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,653
Now imagine he discovers
that his favorite

776
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,440
plaything slash punching bag
is having an affair

777
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:22,943
with his teaching assistant,
Mr. O'Brien.

778
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:27,581
A man like Annunzio, prone
to deviousness and violence,

779
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,200
no doubt started
plotting his revenge.

780
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,920
Problem was,
he began to experience

781
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:35,089
this-this terrible eye pain.

782
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:37,741
He consults a doctor.

783
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,009
He learned his fate.

784
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,344
Rotten luck, or

785
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,412
instant karma... doesn't matter.

786
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:46,016
Annunzio was... was reeling.

787
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,601
All he had left

788
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:50,087
was his intellect
and his anger.

789
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,056
So he devised a plan

790
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:53,690
that would not
only exact revenge

791
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,392
upon his wife and her lover,

792
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:59,730
but also deliver him from
a slow and agonizing death.

793
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:02,533
He found Raul Ramirez,

794
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,201
and he hired him

795
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,103
to be his very own executioner.

796
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,739
After that,

797
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:11,058
it was just a matter of gaining
access to O'Brien's apartment.

798
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,127
Probably with a stolen key.
Mm.

799
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:15,963
He planted evidence
that would implicate O'Brien--

800
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:17,948
the phone used
to contact Ramirez--

801
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,384
and then he writes
a recommendation

802
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,503
that he knows would demonstrate

803
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:24,588
that O'Brien
has motive for murder.

804
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,306
Now all that's
left to do is to

805
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:28,392
destroy any evidence that might

806
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:30,010
unravel his plans:

807
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:31,678
Firstly,
the incriminating videos

808
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,963
he keeps on his computer.

809
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,649
Secondly, his eyes.

810
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:39,820
They're proof that he faced
a long, horrible illness.

811
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:42,139
And he can't risk anyone
discovering his condition.

812
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,307
There may be immediate
questions asked

813
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,326
as to whether he arranged
his own murder.

814
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:48,195
The only thing
he cannot account for

815
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:51,665
is the unpredictable nature
of his would-be assassin.

816
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,167
Ramirez was supposed to kill him

817
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:54,835
when he was on
his way to his car.

818
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:56,670
Instead, he kills him

819
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,422
ahead of schedule, and makes it
look like a robbery gone wrong.

820
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:59,873
Now, that's the last thing

821
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,842
that he wanted.

822
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:05,328
Annunzio wanted all fingers
pointed squarely at O'Brien.

823
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,500
It's not a perfect theory,
Captain, but it fits.

824
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,885
I think that Annunzio's wife

825
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:15,556
and Mr. O'Brien
may well be innocent.

826
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:17,441
Well, let's pretend for
a second that you're right.

827
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:20,177
We can't just
cut O'Brien loose

828
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,695
based on a theory.

829
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:23,530
Not with the phone in evidence,

830
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:24,982
and a signed confession.

831
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:26,683
What about Jun?

832
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,702
We didn't have enough
to hold her.

833
00:36:28,704 --> 00:36:30,053
We cut her loose to I.C.E.

834
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:32,489
They already started
deportation proceedings.

835
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,208
Now, I'm sorry,

836
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,910
if you think this is all
part of a master plan

837
00:36:36,912 --> 00:36:38,361
concocted by the victim,

838
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,715
then it's a damn good one.

839
00:36:58,038 --> 00:36:59,520
This is new.

840
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:01,372
Old data, new location.

841
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:03,691
Thought it might
jar something loose.

842
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:05,493
Did you get
any sleep last night?

843
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:06,761
Hard to sleep

844
00:37:06,763 --> 00:37:08,079
knowing a psychopath
may have managed

845
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:09,881
to ruin two lives
from beyond the grave.

846
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:12,583
Well, for some us,
I suppose.

847
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:14,969
Well, I am gonna

848
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:17,088
have to take a shower
before I go to Rikers.

849
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,507
Carry on.

850
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:22,376
Oh, you weren't kidding
when you said

851
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,095
O'Brien and Ramirez
live close to each other.

852
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:25,379
All part of the frame-up.

853
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:27,014
I know, it's just...

854
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:29,233
if I wanted to hire someone from
my neighborhood to kill you,

855
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:31,519
how would I do it,
go door-to-door?

856
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,504
I'm just saying,
people who kill for money

857
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,156
aren't exactly easy to find.

858
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:36,441
Especially when you're
limited by geography.

859
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:40,495
So, if I wanted you dead,

860
00:37:40,497 --> 00:37:43,281
how would I find
my Raul Ramirez?

861
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:45,850
You'd use a menu.

862
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,630
Sex Offender Registry.

863
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:01,799
You can't look up
killers by locale,

864
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,434
but you can look up rapists.

865
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:04,886
They're a subset
of violent offenders.

866
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:07,772
It's not a leap to imagine

867
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,440
that they would consider
murder for hire

868
00:38:09,442 --> 00:38:12,360
if the price was right.

869
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:14,312
You type in O'Brien's address,

870
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:16,981
find the nearest deviant.

871
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:19,684
Only he wasn't
the nearest one.

872
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:21,936
There's another guy
whose name came up first.

873
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:23,738
Go back a screen.

874
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,990
Dennis Kaminski.

875
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:28,793
Multiple rape convictions,

876
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:31,512
set up hidden cameras
in women's restrooms.

877
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:33,331
And his name came up first

878
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,751
because he lives in
O'Brien's building.

879
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:38,136
I don't get it.

880
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:39,720
If Annunzio wanted
to use proximity

881
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:41,722
to make O'Brien
look guiltier,

882
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:44,725
why didn't he go
to this guy first?

883
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:46,727
Who says he didn't?

884
00:38:48,981 --> 00:38:51,816
I don't know...
I don't know what to say.

885
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:54,735
You don't have
to say anything.

886
00:38:54,737 --> 00:38:57,021
You didn't do what
the police said you did.

887
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,774
Anyway, someone's going to
be here to release you soon.

888
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:05,163
Take care of yourself.

889
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:07,865
That's it?

890
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:10,201
I'm sorry, I guess
I just, I don't know,

891
00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:14,172
I expected a
little more, uh...

892
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:15,423
disappointment.

893
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:18,826
I let that go
a long time ago.

894
00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:21,462
I want to get
clean, Joanie.

895
00:39:21,464 --> 00:39:23,464
Liam...
I mean it.

896
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:26,050
I figure after
everything you did for me,

897
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:27,602
I gotta at least try, right?

898
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,187
You're not supposed
to do it for me,

899
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:31,122
you're supposed to do it for yourself.
I know.

900
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:33,007
Thought maybe,
I don't know,

901
00:39:33,009 --> 00:39:35,009
you could find me
a place to go.

902
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:38,863
My friend runs
the 59th Street Clinic.

903
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:41,482
If I call her now, I'm sure
she'll make room for you.

904
00:39:41,484 --> 00:39:42,900
Like I said,

905
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:45,786
you have to do this
for yourself.

906
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:47,655
I'm not gonna be there
waiting for you.

907
00:39:54,246 --> 00:39:56,113
Y... you mean to say

908
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:59,283
Trent was behind
everything that happened?

909
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:02,169
Before your husband
contracted

910
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,539
Raul Ramirez
to shoot him,

911
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:06,707
he tried another man,

912
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:08,726
one Dennis Kaminski.

913
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:12,096
Mr. Kaminski was more suspicious
of your husband's overtures

914
00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:14,381
than Mr. Ramirez,
he also had more experience

915
00:40:14,383 --> 00:40:16,216
with surveillance equipment.

916
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:18,769
Fearing that the police
were attempting to entrap him,

917
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:21,405
he installed a small camera

918
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:24,075
in the corridor
outside of his apartment.

919
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:25,793
Next time he was contacted

920
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:27,695
by his mystery benefactor,

921
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:29,247
he said it would require
a further $1,000

922
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:32,833
before he would even consider
the offer.

923
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:35,369
The next day,

924
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:37,171
the camera recorded this.

925
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:43,461
Jun?

926
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:45,012
What are you doing here?

927
00:40:45,014 --> 00:40:46,597
Well, thanks to

928
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,383
this video,
Mr. O'Brien was just released,

929
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:51,435
which is bully
for him but, uh...

930
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:53,888
doesn't make you
any more of a citizen.

931
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,090
I'm still going to be deported?

932
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,475
Depends.

933
00:40:57,477 --> 00:40:59,694
Were you serious
the other day when you said

934
00:40:59,696 --> 00:41:02,262
that you two had discussed
the possibility of...

935
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:03,531
tying the knot?

936
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:06,117
Because if you were...

937
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,652
Captain Gregson
has already reached out

938
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:10,204
to a friend of his
in the City Clerk's Office.

939
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,206
I can't make any promises,

940
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,742
but my understanding is

941
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:17,078
if you were to get married today

942
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,580
that I.C.E. will have
to back off.

943
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:23,384
It's not how I thought
we would do it, but...

944
00:41:23,386 --> 00:41:25,002
sure.

945
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,793
♪

946
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:36,180
Good show, Mr. O'Brien.

947
00:41:58,086 --> 00:42:00,871
I texted you.
You didn't have to come.

948
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:02,873
As I explained
the other day,

949
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:05,993
there's nothing more hazardous
to my health than boredom.

950
00:42:07,546 --> 00:42:10,831
Besides, I thought it might
be nice to meet the ex.

951
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:24,695
I'm pretty sure
he's not gonna show.

952
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:26,897
Yet here you sit.

953
00:42:31,903 --> 00:42:34,288
I'll give him
ten more minutes.

954
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:40,494
If there's someplace else
