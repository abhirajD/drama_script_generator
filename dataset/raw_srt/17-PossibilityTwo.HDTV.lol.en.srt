1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,241
Both victims work
for ZBZ Security.

2
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:08,014
Company has a contract

3
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:12,019
with the Turtle Bay Historical
Society right next door.

4
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:14,238
Now, nothing's missing
from the museum.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,656
We're canvassing
the area

6
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:18,525
for the gun, shooter,
any possible witnesses.

7
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:21,078
So, thoughts?

8
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,615
Holmes?
Thoughts?

9
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:25,616
Sorry, sorry.

10
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:27,651
I was waiting
for Miss Watson.

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,620
I'm training her to analyze
every environment

12
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:31,872
with the keen eye
of the true detective.

13
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,425
Watson, thoughts?

14
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:38,178
Um, um...

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,999
Looks like both men have been
shot in the chest one time.

16
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,470
Judging from the scuff marks
on the concrete,

17
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:48,806
looks like they chased
the suspect up here,

18
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,059
who then fired twice
and then ran.

19
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:56,563
It's tough to say where he went.

20
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,066
The reason it's difficult
to say where he ran

21
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:01,151
is that no one ran
anywhere at all.

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,321
Here we have
two deceased gentlemen,

23
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:06,657
both of them wearing
the uniform of ZBZ.

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,242
Or so it would appear.

25
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:11,027
This man's patches were
recently sewn on,

26
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,880
and his clothes are
store-bought,

27
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:15,165
not made by
a uniform company.

28
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,534
So he was posing as a guard.

29
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,703
Nothing is missing
from the museum,

30
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,756
so we assume that he was looking
for access to the parking lot.

31
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:24,391
It's easy to rifle
through the cars

32
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:26,477
if you look like you work
for the security firm.

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,978
Now, what was in
his pockets? Pockets?

34
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,980
Pockets.

35
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:40,190
Yeah, see, you thought
he was a victim,

36
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:42,109
so you were looking
for identification.

37
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,828
But here we have
one, two, three, four

38
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,229
car registration cards.

39
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,165
Each one has
the owner's address on it.

40
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,733
See the game?

41
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,903
Pick an expensive car,
then you call an associate,

42
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,238
who burgles the home
of its owner while they're out.

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,407
This man is
a real security guard.

44
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,377
He saw this fellow
lurking around, followed him.

45
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:02,012
Bad man shoots good man.

46
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:03,597
Good man, while still alive,

47
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,633
wrests control of gun
from bad man, fires one shot.

48
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:08,302
Here we are.

49
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:09,803
One more thing.

50
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:11,271
His cell phone.

51
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,724
You're gonna check
the last number he dialed;

52
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,025
that's his partner.

53
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,194
He's probably robbing
a place right now.

54
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:21,615
Would you like to talk
to the burglar?

55
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:25,285
According to this,
his name is Loco Maurice.

56
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:28,989
You mustn't allow your failure
to discourage you.

57
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,992
(sighs) Didn't fail.
Not discouraged.

58
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:34,545
You didn't solve the case,
but you did notice

59
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:36,279
the incongruity
of the scuff marks.

60
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,664
The next step is learning

61
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,883
to extrapolate your way
to the truth.

62
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,668
Detection is not just
a skill, Watson.

63
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,253
It's a point of view.

64
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:44,922
You must train yourself
to be alert

65
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:46,423
to the bizarre,
the unusual,

66
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:50,177
that which has no place
in any given picture.

67
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:51,512
Like that stretch limo

68
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,514
with the driver staring
straight at us?

69
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:54,565
MAN:
Sherlock Holmes?

70
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,299
My name's Crabtree.

71
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,852
We got your name from
a Mr. Musgrave in London.

72
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:01,271
Local police told us
we'd find you here.

73
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,323
Oh. You say "we."

74
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,141
All I see is a you.

75
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,194
I'm a driver and attaché

76
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:09,079
for Mr. Gerald Lydon
of Lydon Industries.

77
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:10,664
You know the company?

78
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,032
You make everything
from Scotch Tape

79
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:13,667
to diamond-tipped drill bits.

80
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,286
Well, we have all the tape
and drill bits that we need.

81
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:17,621
Thank you very much.

82
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:19,706
Mr. Lydon has a proposal
for you.

83
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,129
I sit before you a lucid man.

84
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:28,098
Vital, I might say.

85
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,851
I hold 18 patents

86
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:33,670
and I can do 11 pull-ups
at age 58.

87
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,557
And I own exactly
16 forks.

88
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,174
I'm not entirely sure

89
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,027
what we're supposed
to be comparing.

90
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:44,314
Well, the point, Mr. Holmes,
is that in my good moments,

91
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm every bit
the man I was.

92
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:48,652
But there are fewer
and fewer of those

93
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,037
because I have dementia.

94
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,822
And it's getting worse,

95
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:55,025
which is why Ms. Tompkins
is following me around.

96
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,877
You have my
condolences.

97
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,079
I don't want your condolences.

98
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,164
I want your help.

99
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,033
Have you ever heard

100
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,869
of hereditary cerebral
amyloid angiopathy?

101
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,804
Hereditary CAA.

102
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,840
It's a genetic disorder.

103
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:12,342
Less than 20,000
cases recorded.

104
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:13,894
Dementia is one

105
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:15,312
of the early symptoms.

106
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,930
And death is the final symptom.

107
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:20,317
And when it comes to me,
it will complete my murder,

108
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,054
because somebody did this to me,
and I need you to find out who.

109
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,357
So, it's a hereditary disorder.

110
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,526
You have to be born with it.

111
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:32,613
And there's no history
of it in my family.

112
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:35,282
They can do a lot of things
in labs now, you know.

113
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:37,417
And I've consulted with
some of the top geneticists,

114
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:39,119
and they tell me
that it's possible

115
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,088
that somebody gave me
this disease,

116
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,756
because they want me
out of power!

117
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:45,125
With all due respect,

118
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,577
maybe these
geneticists are right.

119
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,797
"Possible" does
not mean "likely".

120
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,750
It just means it's
not impossible.

121
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,753
That's what my family says,
that's what the police say,

122
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,556
that I'm paranoid,
that I'm delusional.

123
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:02,258
I hate to say this, but those
are also symptoms of CAA.

124
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,612
Look, they tell me
that you're the best.

125
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:08,949
Mr. Holmes, what will it cost
to buy you over to my side?

126
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,153
I only take cases when I believe
I'm acting in good faith.

127
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:16,623
Now, since I think that
naturally occurring dementia

128
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,626
is by far and away
the most likely explanation

129
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:23,497
for your plight,
I would not be doing that.

130
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:26,783
Would you pull over,
please, Crabtree?

131
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,284
I really am
truly sorry.

132
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,887
And I wish you
the best of luck.

133
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,740
(sizzling)

134
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:58,081
I read the last
stack of books.

135
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,367
No questions... asked.

136
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:04,371
But, uh, Jeremy Bentham is
a utilitarian philosopher.

137
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:06,540
That has nothing to do
with being a detective.

138
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,992
Bentham is the father
of modern criminology.

139
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,828
He said that crime is
the result of free will.

140
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,130
(doorbell rings)

141
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:14,965
Uh, you're gonna put
the acid away

142
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,833
before we answer the door,
right?

143
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:24,141
Delivery for you,
Mr. Holmes.

144
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:26,977
Thank you, Crabtree,
but I'm afraid I...

145
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,645
Oh, my God.

146
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,180
Is that...?

147
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,282
A bee in a box?
Yes, it is.

148
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,868
Fairly unimpressive
as far as bribes go.

149
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,405
Not if you're
an apiculturist.

150
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:42,743
That's an osmia avoseta--
solitary bee

151
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:45,862
famed for building exquisite
nests from flower petals.

152
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,200
It's on the verge
of extinction.

153
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,369
Crabtree, this is exquisite.

154
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,721
I cannot accept it.

155
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:57,557
Please tell Mr. Lydon
not to contact me again.

156
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:00,010
I told him you are a man
of convictions.

157
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,596
Perhaps now
he'll believe me.

158
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,743
This is ridiculous.
Single stick is <i>your</i> hobby.

159
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,561
It's not gonna help me
solve crimes.

160
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,996
(phone ringing)

161
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,782
Aim for the pate.

162
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,399
Good morning, Captain.

163
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,869
GREGSON: Are you in bed with
a guy named Gerald Lydon?

164
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,504
He tried to hire me.
I declined.

165
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,089
Well, that's not what he thinks.

166
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,258
You should get down here.
He's asking for you.

167
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,709
Why?

168
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:35,545
I don't know,
but we just arrested him.

169
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:39,132
He shot his driver--
guy named Crabtree.

170
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:42,035
He's being charged with murder.

171
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,829

173
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:53,991
Lydon says
he can't remember.

174
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:55,993
His nurse witnessed
the whole thing, though.

175
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,196
There was some kind
of episode...

176
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,747
MAN: Yeah, well, I've
been patient. Excuse me.

177
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:01,332
I want to see my father!

178
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,150
No-- Hey, that's not
gonna happen, okay?

179
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:05,036
Your dad killed somebody.
This is a crime scene.

180
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:06,938
You guys got
to step back.

181
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,289
My father is sick.

182
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,374
Lydon's sons.

183
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:12,093
They're hands-on.

184
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:14,762
Anyway, he's asking
for you.

185
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:17,098
Says you're the only one
he'll see.

186
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,268
LYDON: Crabtree worked
for me for 23 years.

187
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,354
I know his partner; I helped
them adopt their daughter.

188
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:26,974
I don't know how I could
think that he would hurt me.

189
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:33,147
I'm-I'm having a hard time
holding on

190
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,017
to what's real
and what isn't.

191
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,537
Uh, this-this conviction

192
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,324
that someone did this to me...

193
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:48,396
...I don't know
where it comes from.

194
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:53,134
And maybe it is a delusion,
but everything in my life

195
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:56,003
feels so slippery,
except for that.

196
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,839
That feels solid.

197
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:02,209
Help me!

198
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:15,356
Hey, why do you have the box
with the bee in it?

199
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,891
We took Gerald
Lydon's case.

200
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:18,242
We did?

201
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:20,111
Well, frankly, I
couldn't say no to him.

202
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:23,531
It would have felt like denying
a dying man his last wish.

203
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,249
We are taking
this home,

204
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:27,568
and then we're going
to the genetics lab

205
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,837
which confirmed
his diagnosis.

206
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:35,927
At Watt Helix, we always say our
work isn't just about genetics.

207
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:39,130
It's about healthier food.
It's about a longer life.

208
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:40,948
It's about you.

209
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,550
Utter pabulum.

210
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:44,135
You'd think corporate science
would maintain

211
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:46,604
some vestige of dignity.

212
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:47,939
His portrait
was painted

213
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,724
by Kirian Boyd;
that's impressive.

214
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:53,561
This place is
a tower of ego.

215
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:55,530
So, you're Sherlock Holmes?

216
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:56,480
Hi.

217
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,265
And Joan
Watson, right?

218
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,734
Yes. Hi.

219
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,619
I'm Raph Keating;
I'm president here.

220
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,103
This is Natasha
Kademan.

221
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:04,605
She heads up the
medical research team.

222
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:07,575
'Tash, meet Holmes
and... Watson.

223
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,911
Hi.
Natasha Kademan. I know that name.

224
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:11,128
You wrote your dissertation

225
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,830
on "The Warrior Gene,"
did you not?

226
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:15,049
Ms. Kademan conducted
a study which many say

227
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:17,218
isolated the gene responsible
for sociopathic behavior.

228
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,170
Sterling work.

229
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,555
And why are you

230
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:21,839
plowing these fields?

231
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,624
My funding dried up.

232
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:27,261
The receptionist said you have
a question about Gerald Lydon.

233
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:31,399
Lydon thinks
someone gave him CAA?

234
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,184
Did you know
about this?

235
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:36,437
Sure. He used to talk
about it when he came in.

236
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,990
It sounded...
delusional.

237
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,608
And it may well be.

238
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,810
But Mr. Lydon insists
that geneticists,

239
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:45,279
whose names escape
him at the moment,

240
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,949
assure him that it is
technically possible.

241
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,500
You diagnosed
his condition,

242
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:51,535
your lab has researched
the disease extensively.

243
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:53,037
Is it?

244
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,591
I guess if you had
unlimited money, a great lab,

245
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:58,259
you probably could do it.

246
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,512
The CAA comes from a mutation
of the APP gene.

247
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:03,431
There may be seven people
out there

248
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:06,500
that might be able
to crack it.

249
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,469
Could I have their names
and addresses, please?

250
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,470
Seriously?

251
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,606
Mm-hmm.

252
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:21,282
(Holmes speaking Norwegian)

253
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:29,857
Hey, what's this?

254
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,459
You're a detective
now; you tell me.

255
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:32,860
Uh, it looks like

256
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:34,655
you left your dry cleaning
ticket for me.

257
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,497
Yes.

258
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:37,748
The reason being...
as well as being colleagues,

259
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,751
we are now embarking on a quite
unusual domestic partnership,

260
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:44,422
so we should aggregate our
errands, not duplicate them.

261
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:47,258
So, I get the dry cleaning
and you get what?

262
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,344
I shall clean our refrigerator
once monthly. Agreeable?

263
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,063
You should pick that up early.

264
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:53,681
We're leaving
for Norway tomorrow.

265
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:54,982
What?

266
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:56,150
I've been delving into

267
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:57,985
our "magnificent seven"
geneticists,

268
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,737
and I have discovered
a connection

269
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,689
which merits further
exploration.

270
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,275
This is Dr.
Ingvald Moller.

271
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:05,943
He runs a lab in Oslo,

272
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,895
which specializes in the study

273
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:10,865
of rare genetic
disorders.

274
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,750
(grunts)
He looks very...

275
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,286
Scandinavian.
He does.

276
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:18,456
Now, his lab is affiliated
with the National University,

277
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,542
which means it's publically
funded, and yet Dr. Moller

278
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:24,378
recently put a down payment on
a home on the Geiranger Fjord,

279
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,847
which was once owned by
the Norwegian royal family.

280
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:28,382
Lovely place.

281
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,584
Well outside what a public
servant could afford.

282
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:34,388
And interestingly,
his loan papers were cosigned

283
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,025
by one Carter Lydon.

284
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:41,395
Okay, so you think that Carter
paid this guy to figure out

285
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,614
how to give his father CAA.
Interesting.

286
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:45,316
But why do we have
to go to Norway?

287
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:46,650
Carter Lydon lives
right here.

288
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:48,536
I would rather question
a scientist

289
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:50,321
than a businessman.

290
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:52,656
And Norway has fjords
and glaciers,

291
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:55,109
and women reared on a diet
of wild-caught salmon.

292
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:56,077
Oh, that explains it.

293
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,244
(cell phone dings)

294
00:12:57,246 --> 00:13:00,214
Looks like a molecule.

295
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:03,050
(cell phone dings)

296
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,922
"The thing itself"--
that's a weird way to put it.

297
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:09,340
The warrior gene.

298
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:13,260
The warrior gene--
where's the dissertation?

299
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,101
This is Natasha Kademan's

300
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:23,303
monograph.

301
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:26,857
I seem to remember
something in the conclusion.

302
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:33,748
"When it comes to understanding
sociopathic behavior,

303
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,816
"understanding the warrior
gene is paramount.

304
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,818
It is the
thing itself."

305
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,920
So Natasha sent this.

306
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:42,489
She knows
what's going on.

307
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:50,330
Now she's panicking.

308
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:52,716
Now she's trying to
figure out her next move.

309
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:55,603
And if she's as smart
as she seems to be,

310
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:58,505
now she's realizing we
are her best option.

311
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:02,843
(cell phone dings)

312
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:14,822
Ms. Kademan?

313
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,076
Hello?

314
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,730
We found electrician's tape
covering the lock

315
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,233
on one of the back doors.

316
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:43,285
It looks like someone slipped in
to commit a burglary,

317
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,753
found Ms. Kademan
working late.

318
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,655
What were they trying
to burgle, blood samples?

319
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,439
No, I think not.

320
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,208
Ms. Kademan's murder
was connected

321
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,861
to the Gerald Lydon case.

322
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:55,080
The Gerald Lydon
case is closed.

323
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:57,299
I'm not talking about
the murder of his chauffeur.

324
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,668
I am talking about
the investigation into who gave

325
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,087
the man a substance
which induced his CAA.

326
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,756
Our most promising
suspect at the moment

327
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:06,925
is Lydon's son, Carter.

328
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:09,794
CAA is inherited; you can't
just give it to somebody.

329
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,462
Ms. Kademan thought
it was possible.

330
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:13,732
In fact, she thought
that's exactly what happened.

331
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,066
You believe her?

332
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:16,568
She made someone
nervous enough

333
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,570
to stab her
half a dozen times.

334
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:21,724
I'm inclined
to explore further.

335
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:24,143
this was no robbery.

336
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:26,262
That portrait...

337
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:29,065
was done by
Kirian Boyd.

338
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,517
It is by far the most
valuable object in here.

339
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,736
Oh, but it was
until it was stained

340
00:15:33,738 --> 00:15:36,272
with several drops
of the killer's blood.

341
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:38,390
The victim's blood is
all over the place.

342
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,493
What makes you think that
came from the killer?

343
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,328
Excellent question.

344
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,496
Watson.

345
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,566
Uh, um...

346
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:51,070
Well, (sighs)

347
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:54,590
the spatters on the floor
indicate that she was

348
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:56,742
facing away from the portrait
when she was stabbed.

349
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:59,578
Um, all of her wounds are
on her anterior side,

350
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,049
so it's tough to see how her
blood ended up on the portrait.

351
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,468
Um, now if she tried
to fight back, then...

352
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,420
Then it's easy to see how
a blow to the killer's face

353
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:10,389
might result in
those stains.

354
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:11,641
Kudos, Watson.

355
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:12,809
Adequately done.

356
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:15,528
Oh, my God.

357
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,029
'Tash.

358
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,147
Who's that?

359
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,365
Victim's fiancé.

360
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,267
Came down for the I.D.

361
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:24,120
I knew that she was working
with a dementia patient

362
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:27,273
named Gerald Lydon,
but 'Tash never told me

363
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:30,960
that she thought
somebody dosed him.

364
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:33,029
I'm-I'm a geneticist, too,
so I'm pretty sure

365
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,014
she would've said something.

366
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:36,332
(sighs)

367
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,351
Honestly, I thought
you were gonna ask me

368
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:39,585
about that guy Benny.

369
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,220
Benny?

370
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:43,923
(groans) Cordaro?

371
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:46,642
Cordero?

372
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:49,128
He was in prison
for stabbing someone

373
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,298
when 'Tash was doing
her warrior gene research.

374
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,268
He claimed that she used his
blood without permission.

375
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,988
He came down here, like, a
month ago to scream at her.

376
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,357
Well, we'll look into it.

377
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:04,076
(woman singing in French
over speakers)

378
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,456
Oh, I haven't seen those
since organic chem.

379
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,958
Natasha thought you could
induce CAA.

380
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,626
You think that's how you do it?

381
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:23,212
Certainly seems possible.

382
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:25,464
But this--
Oh, don't touch.

383
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:28,551
Obviously, this is
a rendering of a molecule,

384
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:31,437
but the elements aren't labeled,
so I can't tell which molecule.

385
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,606
Until I do,
I can't say for certain.

386
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,474
Well, she did give you a list
of the best geneticists

387
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,560
in the world; have you thought
about asking one of them?

388
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:39,812
You mean our pool of suspects?

389
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:43,032
Hmm. If I haven't decoded
this thing by morning,

390
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:46,152
we'll send it to someone
unconnected with the case.

391
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:09,141
I worked hard on that dinosaur.

392
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:11,894
(sighing)

393
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:14,146
I spent some time with that
picture Natasha sent last night.

394
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:16,349
I figured out most of
the elements, and then the rest

395
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,150
I sent on to my old
genetics professor.

396
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:19,569
In the middle of the night?

397
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,103
Well, he has insomnia,
so he's always up

398
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,605
between 2:00 and 4:00 anyway.

399
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:24,991
You were romantically involved

400
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:26,692
with your genetics instructor.

401
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:27,994
Jerry was amazed by this.

402
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:29,245
He said it was like

403
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,496
looking at
something out of

404
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:32,198
Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbook.

405
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,699
It's a man-made chemical

406
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:35,785
from the polycyclic
hydrocarbon family.

407
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:39,005
It's like we thought.

408
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,423
This is a mutagen

409
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,241
that targets the
stretch of the genome

410
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:46,379
that is responsible
for hereditary CAA.

411
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,130
That's quite beautiful.

412
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,181
So,

413
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:50,766
all we have to do now is prove

414
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:52,635
that someone paid a genius
to develop this

415
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:54,420
and then used it
on Gerald Lydon.

416
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:57,607
That should be
a fascinating day's work.

417
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:59,725
It's cold.
Did you pick up my sweaters?

418
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:01,093
Seriously?

419
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:02,778
I will thank you
for the molecular formula

420
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,731
when I'm sufficiently warm
to do so.

421
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:06,999
(sighs)

422
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:15,291
(man speaking Polish
over television)

423
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,326
(doorbells jingle)

424
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,914
Hi.

425
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,382
(groans)

426
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:25,918
(speaking Polish)

427
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:33,843
She say, "Wait one second,
almost commercial."

428
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:51,310
(speaking Polish)

429
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,998
She say she never
seen you before.

430
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,617
Uh, I'm here
for a friend.

431
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,536
Wow, that's
quite a coat.

432
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:02,755
It's warm.

433
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:14,050
Um, don't you want money?

434
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:17,103
(speaking Polish)

435
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:19,405
(speaking Polish)

436
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:21,891
She says $75.

437
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:24,176
For four sweaters?

438
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:26,312
Okay, $19 then.

439
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:38,157
Um, could I get a receipt?

440
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,408
No.

441
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:46,198
(doorbells jingle)

442
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,583
GREGSON:
<i>So, Benny, you're saying</i>

443
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:49,402
<i>you were mad at Ms. Kademan.</i>

444
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:51,670
Hell yeah, I
was mad at her.

445
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:53,589
I signed up for her study
to get brownie points

446
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,924
with the parole board.

447
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:57,259
She called me
an incurable sociopath.

448
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:59,211
You think that didn't
add time to my sentence?

449
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:01,547
So you went to Ms. Kademan's
office a few weeks ago

450
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:04,066
to threaten her, and last
night you killed her.

451
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:05,317
BENNY:
No.

452
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,270
GREGSON:
You don't have an alibi.

453
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:10,573
BENNY:
Yeah, but it wasn't like that.

454
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:13,025
What's with Main
Moon Dry Cleaning?

455
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:16,695
I'll admit the new management
is not much for efficiency,

456
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,330
but I find them charming.
(groans)

457
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:20,750
That's Benjamin Cordero.

458
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:23,369
Career blackmailer,
general blackguard.

459
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:26,005
Also innocent of the murder
of Natasha Kademan,

460
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:28,591
which I would very much like
to get back to solving.

461
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:31,093
BELL:
We don't need your DNA, genius.

462
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:32,795
You're a convicted felon.

463
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:34,263
We got a sample on file.

464
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:36,749
(cell phones ding)

465
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,145
GREGSON: Which means you got
a very short window

466
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:50,813
to cooperate with us.

467
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:53,566
(cell phones ding)

468
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:00,956
So, you want to make
a statement?

469
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,158
(banging on window)

470
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,877
You delay,
but time will not!

471
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:10,332
That's a quote--

472
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:12,618
Benjamin Franklin.
I know who said it.

473
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,804
I just don't know why you're
shouting it through the mirror!

474
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,672
This crime has
a certain elegance to it.

475
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:19,458
It involves careful planning,
scientific innovation,

476
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,227
a country home in
the Norwegian fjords.

477
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:23,229
That prosaic individual
has no place in it.

478
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:24,963
He had beef with
Natasha Kademan.

479
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:26,465
He's been to jail
for a stabbing.

480
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,150
Okay by you if
we run his DNA?

481
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:31,136
It's not my place
to tell you your job.

482
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,656
But by the time
you get your results back,

483
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:36,325
I will be that much closer
to proving that someone,

484
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,527
most probably Carter Lydon
working in concert

485
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,312
with a Norwegian geneticist,

486
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:43,148
poisoned Gerald Lydon with
a hitherto nonexistent compound

487
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,500
and then murdered
Natasha Kademan

488
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,452
when she found out
what they were up to.

489
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:47,670
Oh, I take it back.

490
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:50,873
Your version sounds
much more plausible.

491
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,758
Sorry, you think
there's actually something

492
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,210
to my dad's story?

493
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:55,761
We do.

494
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:58,264
And we think that elements
within the company

495
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:00,316
may be responsible.

496
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:01,967
Elements?
What elements?

497
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,235
I'd rather not say.

498
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:04,670
What I would like

499
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,522
is root access
to your company's servers.

500
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:09,191
We may be able to build a case
by tracking e-mails.

501
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:12,561
Uh, I mean, I don't know
if I can do that, guys.

502
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:14,530
I mean, there are big
changes coming here.

503
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:16,515
I don't even know what job
I'm gonna have next week.

504
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:18,484
Your job?
We're talking about your father.

505
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:19,702
CARTER:
My father doesn't

506
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:21,453
need your help.

507
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:23,205
That's for him
to determine.

508
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,023
Thanks for your text.
Mm-hmm.

509
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:27,209
And actually,
it's not my dad's decision.

510
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:29,545
He was declared legally
incompetent this morning.

511
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:31,997
Your services are
no longer needed.

512
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,666
Get out.

513
00:23:33,668 --> 00:23:35,417
Actually, our contract
with your father calls

514
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,203
for termination in writing,
countersigned by both parties.

515
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:44,927
Sign here.

516
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:47,513
WATSON:
<i>It worked.</i>

517
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:48,931
The thing with
the termination letter.

518
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,482
I mean, obviously
we don't even have

519
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:51,901
a contract with Gerald Lydon,

520
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:54,386
but I noticed that Carter
bites his nails.

521
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:56,054
People who bite
their nails tend

522
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:57,523
to chew writing
implements as well.

523
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,575
Well, he never
asked for it back.

524
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:02,077
You know,
maybe we can get a DNA sample.

525
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,647
If he killed Natasha,
then we've got him.

526
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:06,615
I just need a plastic bag.

527
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,335
Not a bad gambit, Watson, though
a hair sample would be better.

528
00:24:09,337 --> 00:24:10,786
A hair sample?

529
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:12,288
What do you want from me?

530
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,956
Nothing. I have
a sample already.

531
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:17,576
Carter, like many people
who slick their hair back,

532
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:20,245
carries a comb, so I
picked his pockets.

533
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:22,381
If you want to
be a detective,

534
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:25,301
you should get in the habit
of carrying evidence bags.

535
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:30,723
(cell phone ringing)

536
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:32,591
Detective Bell.

537
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:35,594
We may well have
cracked the case.

538
00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:38,030
Benny Cordero's DNA
came back a match

539
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:39,565
for the blood at the scene.

540
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:41,233
I hate to burst your bubble,

541
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:44,320
but we're booking him
for murder.

542
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:54,738
That's not my blood.
No way, no how.

543
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:56,072
It's not even possible.

544
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,207
Look, we test 13 different
genetic markers.

545
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,659
Every single one of them
was a perfect match.

546
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:02,028
Then somebody set me up.

547
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,046
Look, I know
this looks bad.

548
00:25:04,048 --> 00:25:06,482
Doesn't look like anything.

549
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:07,867
We know what happened.

550
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:09,719
It's over.

551
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:13,389
W-What if I did have
an alibi?

552
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,876
I live
in this courtyard building,

553
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:19,562
and the couple across the way,

554
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:21,097
they don't close
their blinds that much.

555
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:22,381
I notice stuff

556
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:25,017
with the husband
and the nanny.

557
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:28,938
Just holding hands first,
then some kissing.

558
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,723
So the night
the Kademan lady got killed,

559
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:34,744
I got my camera out,
I put the zoom lens on.

560
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:36,662
So you're saying your alibi

561
00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:39,365
is that you were home,
taking blackmail shots

562
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:40,899
of one of your neighbors?

563
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:43,452
Well... yeah.

564
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:51,460
Are these the same sweaters
I picked up yesterday?

565
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,912
You're a detective
now; you tell me.

566
00:25:53,914 --> 00:25:56,415
Yes, same sweaters.

567
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,300
You left them outside my room
by accident?

568
00:25:58,302 --> 00:25:59,685
I was setting
up to practice

569
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:00,970
my calligraphy
at the same time

570
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:02,271
I was unpacking
the dry cleaning.

571
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:03,939
There was a mishap.

572
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:06,058
We agreed that you were in
charge of the dry cleaning,

573
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,611
but we didn't say how
often you'd have to go.

574
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:09,928
Fine, well,
I'm picking another place.

575
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,313
When they're
your clothes,

576
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:12,898
you're free to go
wherever you like.

577
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,483
My clothes have to
go to Main Moon.

578
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,101
I'm sensitive to the
chemicals in dry cleaning,

579
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:17,536
and they use only the
gentlest emollients.

580
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:18,871
Really?
Yes.

581
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:21,123
Now, as much as I
love dry cleaning,

582
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,275
I'm trying to get
some thinking done.

583
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:26,412
Oh, so you still think Benny
Cordero didn't kill Natasha?

584
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:29,081
Never mind the fact that
no one plans a blackmail

585
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,050
and commits murder
on the same evening,

586
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:32,951
the man has no connection
to the Lydons,

587
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,336
and his supposed victim

588
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:37,006
texted us the formula
for inducing CAA

589
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:39,124
and got stabbed
20 minutes later.

590
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,976
Can't be a coincidence.

591
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:44,480
I'm trying to think of
alternative explanations.

592
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:45,731
Possibility one

593
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:48,267
is obvious,
which is why Mr. Cordero

594
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:49,768
put it forth himself.

595
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,103
Someone got ahold
of his blood

596
00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:52,822
and then planted it
at the crime scene.

597
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:54,106
Not unheard of,

598
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:56,108
but also an
investigative dead end.

599
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,977
I can't prove that
it didn't happen.

600
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:00,863
I get absolutely nowhere
looking into it.

601
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:03,616
There's no evidence that anyone
other than Benny Cordero

602
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:05,317
was at Watt Helix
that night,

603
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,087
which is why I'm considering
possibility two.

604
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,589
WATSON:
It's blank.

605
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:13,509
Possibility two has stubbornly
refused to reveal itself.

606
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,994
Well, keep staring
at the wall.

607
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:18,631
I'm sure it's hiding
in there somewhere.

608
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:25,304
(speaking Polish)

609
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:26,672
(doorbells jingle)

610
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:28,257
Hi again.

611
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,393
Little accident
with the sweaters.

612
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:36,181
Slow day yesterday?

613
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:38,817
(speaking Polish)

614
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:46,408
She say, "Why you ask that?"

615
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,829
So she understands English,
she just doesn't speak it?

616
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:54,466
I'm only asking because, uh,

617
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,535
that mink coat is
in the same exact place

618
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:57,887
it was yesterday,
so that means

619
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,506
that hasn't been turned on
since I left.

620
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:02,874
(speaking Polish)

621
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,234
She say, "Slow day yesterday."

622
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:15,854
Do dry cleaners
get robbed a lot?

623
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:18,490
I just noticed that you have

624
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:20,058
six very expensive
security cameras here

625
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,745
and then two more
at the front door.

626
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:24,196
Seems like a lot.

627
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:26,064
They came when we buy place.

628
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,182
Problem?

629
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:28,567
No, that's not...

630
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:31,086
That's not a problem.

631
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:34,072
Thanks.

632
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:36,575
(doorbells jingle)

633
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:38,427
I figured it out.

634
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:39,712
I-I'm sorry to interrupt,

635
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:42,097
um, but I know exactly
what you were up to.

636
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,299
I sincerely doubt that.

637
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,916
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

638
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:46,852
There is a reason why you keep
sending me to Main Moon.

639
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:48,637
They don't do any business,
they don't even know

640
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,773
how much to charge, and they
have a load of security cameras.

641
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:52,057
There's definitely
something going on.

642
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,392
Watson, I admire
your enthusiasm.

643
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:55,110
I have no idea
what you're on about.

644
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:56,762
You wanted me to notice.

645
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,597
I wanted my sweaters.

646
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,150
Now, I know I have counseled you
to be alert,

647
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:03,268
but that doesn't mean that
there is a conspiracy lurking

648
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,536
behind every door.

649
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:06,655
Okay, so what are
you up to then?

650
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:09,941
After you went to bed,
I spent a good hour

651
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:11,577
trying to reckon
how an innocent man's blood

652
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:13,579
could wind up at the scene
of a murder

653
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,164
if it wasn't planted there.

654
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,967
Then I remembered
something that you said.

655
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,635
The late Mrs. Kademan
gave us a list

656
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:21,920
of the top geneticists
in the world.

657
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:23,789
Why not ask them?

658
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:26,091
Everyone, say hello
to Miss Watson.

659
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:27,309
ALL:
Hi.

660
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:29,178
Good morning.

661
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,563
I left Dr. Moller from Norway
off the list.

662
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:34,066
Now, the others were
a bit confused at first,

663
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:36,301
but after I posed
the problem to them,

664
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,604
we had quite
a lively discussion, didn't we?

665
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:39,938
Yes.

666
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,359
Turns out,
there is another possibility.

667
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:45,944
Jurgi, would you please explain
your breakthrough

668
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:47,529
to Miss Watson?

669
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:51,083
It's quite simple, really,
though I should give you

670
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:53,118
a grounding
in cellular biology.

671
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,821
Another time perhaps, Jurgi.
Actually, you know what,

672
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:57,656
I'll call you all back.
Thank you.

673
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:59,541
He's a brilliant man,
little bit long-winded.

674
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:03,829
Gist of it is: law enforcement
runs a standard DNA test

675
00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:05,097
called STR analysis.

676
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:07,549
It's actually a
bit imprecise.

677
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,835
It tests 13 loci
against each other,

678
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:12,521
when there are
countless possibilities.

679
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:15,274
All assembled agree
that technology has advanced

680
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:17,643
to the point
where you could manufacture

681
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:20,446
a match of 13 loci.

682
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,865
So you're saying you can fake
a DNA sample?

683
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:25,034
All you would need is access
to a top-tier lab

684
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,119
and access
to someone's genetic code.

685
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:29,705
And I'm not just saying
that you could do it,

686
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:32,107
I just regathered my
round table to tell them

687
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,460
that in this case,
someone did do it.

688
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:36,628
How could you
possibly know that?

689
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,364
I called in a favor

690
00:30:39,366 --> 00:30:42,000
from the medical examiner's
DNA lab.

691
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:44,035
They provided a sample
of the blood found

692
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:45,704
at the scene of Natasha
Kademan's murder

693
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:47,389
for a full workup.

694
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:49,892
A friend of Jurgi's at
Columbia handled the analysis.

695
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:52,978
All 13 loci tested
in STR analysis

696
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,514
were a perfect match
for Benny Cordero,

697
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:59,184
but there were no other
loci at all in the sample.

698
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,906
So you're saying someone
stripped a blood sample

699
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:05,190
of its genetic material

700
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:06,859
and then created a match
for the loci

701
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:08,444
they knew the police
would check?

702
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:11,864
Only a geneticist would be able
to carry that out.

703
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:14,733
It seems like everyone connected
to this case is a geneticist.

704
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:17,068
But only one pointed us
in the direction

705
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,038
of Benny Cordero
in the first place.

706
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,574
GREGSON: So, this
morning, my consultant

707
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:25,043
marches into my office
and says the damndest thing.

708
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:29,715
He thinks it's possible
to manufacture a DNA sample.

709
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:33,135
Thing is, he
was right.

710
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:35,604
The blood that we found

711
00:31:35,606 --> 00:31:38,256
at the scene
of your fiancée's murder,

712
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:41,393
it didn't belong
to Benny Cordero.

713
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:44,146
It was just designed
to look that way.

714
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:47,699
Well, that sounds kind of crazy.

715
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:50,619
Now, you work for
Ubient Pharmaceuticals, right?

716
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:52,704
I bet they have nice labs.

717
00:31:52,706 --> 00:31:54,206
What are you saying?

718
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,574
Paul, come on.

719
00:31:55,576 --> 00:31:57,876
We know the sample was faked.

720
00:31:57,878 --> 00:32:02,113
We know you pointed us at Benny
Cordero in the first place.

721
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:05,918
We know you had access to his
genetic makeup via your fiancée.

722
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,452
We know your employer

723
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:10,389
has probably the top
lab in the city.

724
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:11,924
We also have a
pretty good idea

725
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:14,259
of the equipment you'd
need to manufacture

726
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:15,894
a fake DNA sample.

727
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:18,230
Now, we can get a court
order to look at it,

728
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:20,315
but as it turns out,
we don't need to.

729
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:22,634
We shared everything
we know with your bosses.

730
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:24,486
They gave us access.

731
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:29,140
Our crime scene unit is
processing the lab as we speak.

732
00:32:29,142 --> 00:32:30,759
You may think you've
covered your tracks,

733
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:33,812
but if you made the sample
there, we' find it.

734
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:41,286
Why did you murder your fiancée?

735
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:50,012
(chuckles)

736
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:52,347
Right after we got engaged,

737
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:55,517
'Tash and I had complete
genetic workups done.

738
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,271
Natasha asked them to check
us both for the warrior gene,

739
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:02,841
the gene that she isolated
in her research--

740
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:06,778
just being thorough.

741
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,699
Turns out, I have it.

742
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:14,203
My DNA says I'm a sociopath.

743
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:17,489
She said it wouldn't
change anything, but...

744
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:20,325
I could feel her pulling away.

745
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:23,212
Then the late-night
phone calls started,

746
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:24,830
the long hours at work.

747
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:27,382
She was moving on.

748
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:29,501
Moving on and stepping out.

749
00:33:29,503 --> 00:33:31,503
You think she was
cheating on you?

750
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:33,171
A guy knows.

751
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:34,840
And I even had a name.

752
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:37,208
Lincoln Dunwoody.

753
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:41,396
I knew that she was planning
to leave,

754
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:43,682
and she doesn't get
to make that call.

755
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:46,985
So you're saying you
murdered her out of jealousy?

756
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:52,024
I guess I knew for a while
that it was gonna end like this.

757
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:54,059
That's why I made the blood.

758
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:55,494
But last Tuesday,

759
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:58,697
she called to cancel
our dinner date

760
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:01,033
on my birthday.

761
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,953
That was it.

762
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:06,722
So where does
Carter Lydon fit in?

763
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:09,007
The formula for inducing
hereditary CAA?

764
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:11,710
I don't know what
you're talking about.

765
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:14,846
I'm talking about the plan
to poison Gerald Lydon.

766
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:17,349
(sighs)
Look, I killed 'Tash.

767
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:19,384
Okay? I am telling you that.

768
00:34:19,386 --> 00:34:22,771
But I don't know
how to induce CAA.

769
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:26,058
I don't even remember
what it stands for.

770
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:30,562
(phones ringing,
people talking quietly)

771
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:39,955
Hey.

772
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:42,440
I caught most of the Reeves
stuff from the bullpen,

773
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:44,743
then Bell filled me in
on the rest.

774
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:48,163
Look, I know you thought
it was all connected

775
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:51,783
and that finding Natasha's
killer was gonna help explain

776
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:53,218
what happened to
Gerald Lydon,

777
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,253
but it didn't work
out that way.

778
00:34:55,255 --> 00:34:57,923
But we do have a
murderer in custody,

779
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:00,291
and you got around
a fake DNA sample.

780
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:02,728
Strange name.

781
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,597
Did you know there's no one
called Lincoln Dunwoody

782
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,099
in the whole of New York?

783
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:09,484
At first, I thought
Natasha Kademan's

784
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:12,270
paramour was using
a fake name for their affair.

785
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:13,655
But...

786
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:17,576
...when you separate
the two names,

787
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:20,412
treat them as two surnames
rather than

788
00:35:20,414 --> 00:35:24,282
one nonexistent person, you get
a very interesting result.

789
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:27,419
This Lincoln family

790
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:29,621
has a long history
of generous philanthropy.

791
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:33,959
So, too, does
this Dunwoody family.

792
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,878
The Lincoln family's
patriarch is James Lincoln.

793
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,130
He recently retired

794
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:41,166
after a sudden
and unexpected diagnosis

795
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:45,137
of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

796
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:47,723
There's no history of
the disease in his family.

797
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:49,358
Hmm.

798
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,109
That is weird.

799
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:53,979
I don't think Natasha Kademan
was having an affair at all.

800
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:56,732
I think she was trying to expose
a plot to poison these men.

801
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:59,785
Well, you only know
of two cases, right?

802
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:01,620
I mean, CAA is
incredibly rare,

803
00:36:01,622 --> 00:36:03,855
but that could be
just a coincidence.

804
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:06,491
What if there was
a third person stricken?

805
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:08,326
Is there?

806
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:10,045
I don't know.

807
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:13,465
But I do know that
a woman called Greta Dunwoody

808
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:17,335
recently retired as president
of her family's foundation.

809
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:18,837
She's dropped off
the society pages,

810
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,922
and no one is quite sure
what's happened to her.

811
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:23,141
Well, we need
to find her.

812
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:25,560
Apparently, the family's
keeping shtum.

813
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:27,846
But read the list of grants.

814
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:34,569
Well, they just donated $20
million to St. Bede's Hospital.

815
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,405
If she was sick, I would say

816
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:39,057
that would be a good place
to start looking.

817
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:43,195
(piano playing classical music)

818
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,874
Ms. Dunwoody?

819
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:57,626
(music stops)

820
00:36:57,628 --> 00:37:00,512
They told us
we'd find you in here.

821
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:02,580
Um... these are for you.

822
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:05,600
They're beautiful.

823
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:07,602
Thank you.

824
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:10,722
You're not my son, are you?

825
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,107
No, we...

826
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:14,559
we just thought we'd
check in on you.

827
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,728
Oh, that's nice.

828
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:20,098
Do you mind if I practice?

829
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,786
I have to keep practicing
if I want to get into Juilliard.

830
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:26,705
(plays out of tune chord)

831
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:28,606
(playing classical music)

832
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:30,575
Amazing.

833
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:33,662
The brain decays, but
muscle memory remains.

834
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:37,699
Gerald Lydon wasn't
the only target.

835
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,918
Someone's poisoning
these people.

836
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,438
WATSON: You're cleaning
the fridge out now?

837
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,123
It's my half of our agreement.

838
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,609
Well, I was hoping
you could help me figure out

839
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:58,077
who's giving
rich people CAA.

840
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,213
Yes, that was
first on my list.

841
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:02,164
Now the refrigerator.

842
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,134
You have a suspect. Who?

843
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:08,037
You're a detective;
you tell me.

844
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,906
(sighs)
Fine.

845
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:11,140
Uh...

846
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:12,592
Okay, it's not Carter Lydon.

847
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:15,094
I mean, he has a motive
to want his father sick,

848
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:17,930
but he has no reason
to attack strangers.

849
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:21,234
Maybe he cosigned that loan
for that guy in Norway

850
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:22,768
because he wanted him

851
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,153
to help with
his father's case.

852
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:26,188
So who does have
motive to attack

853
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,658
three seemingly
unconnected strangers?

854
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,910
The victims are
three rich people.

855
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,945
They all have
charitable foundations.

856
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,780
The only people
that would benefit

857
00:38:34,782 --> 00:38:37,450
from wealthy philanthropists
coming down with CAA

858
00:38:37,452 --> 00:38:41,087
are the people raising money
to study the disease.

859
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:44,123
Induce CAA in some of
New York's wealthiest,

860
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:47,293
then sit back and wait
for donations to flow in.

861
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:48,844
Not all the victims
would contribute,

862
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,880
so you'd have
to dose more than one.

863
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:52,932
Did you know
the Lincoln Foundation

864
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:54,183
gave a rather generous grant

865
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:56,469
to the research labs
at Watt Helix?

866
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:58,170
Natasha's company.

867
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:01,774
She was a whistle-blower.

868
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,359
There's got to be,
what, 50 people

869
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:04,727
working in research there?

870
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,779
But how many of them
are capable of inventing

871
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:10,650
an entirely new molecule
which attacks a specific gene?

872
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,818
Well, it's got to be
the smartest person there.

873
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,620
Of course,

874
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:19,375
that person might not still
work there on a daily basis.

875
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,331
GREGSON:
<i>Mr. Watt,</i>

876
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,967
did you know that before
Ms. Kademan was killed,

877
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:30,586
she was working to
expose a scandal?

878
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:32,638
It's quite a story.

879
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,540
She thought that
someone at Watt Helix

880
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,976
was inducing mutations
in wealthy people

881
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:40,563
to attract funding
for research into CAA.

882
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,266
We think she was right.

883
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:46,819
That's... shocking.

884
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:48,387
I assume
you have evidence.

885
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:52,391
Whoever developed
the molecule was brilliant.

886
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:54,393
A towering intellect.

887
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,245
Someone a lot like you.

888
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:58,581
I hope that's not
an accusation.

889
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,750
Brian Watt is
a decorated physician.

890
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:02,568
He has a sterling
reputation.

891
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,571
Why would he risk that for...
whatever you're describing?

892
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,906
We spent a good deal of time

893
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:11,594
puzzling over that ourselves,
didn't we? Yeah.

894
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:13,629
We came up with a theory,
but we couldn't be

895
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:15,881
sure of it until we got
a good look at you.

896
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,751
You have hereditary CAA,
don't you, Mr. Watt?

897
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:20,219
That's why you're semi-retired,
and that's why

898
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:22,104
you haven't said a word
since you came in.

899
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:24,306
We know it's in your family.

900
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:26,942
Probably why you got into
genetics in the first place,

901
00:40:26,944 --> 00:40:28,927
find a way around
the death sentence

902
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,563
that you carry in your DNA.

903
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:32,565
But you got sick.

904
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:34,600
Research wasn't
going fast enough.

905
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:36,369
So in your more lucid moments,

906
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:38,537
you hatch a plan to attract
bigger and bigger money.

907
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,373
All you'd
have to do

908
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,742
is to introduce the chemical
you developed

909
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:45,378
into someone's I.V.

910
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,381
All the victims had procedures
at Stuyvesant Memorial,

911
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:50,916
a hospital where you still
hold privileges.

912
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:55,805
You're wrong.

913
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:57,590
Well, then, you won't mind

914
00:40:57,592 --> 00:40:59,308
if we take a look
inside your home, will you?

915
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,461
'Cause there won't be
any more of the chemical

916
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:04,096
needed for
further attacks.

917
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:06,832
We have team of detectives
heading to his home

918
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,367
as we speak.

919
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,902
REPORTER:
<i>A stunning arrest today,</i>

920
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:12,037
as entrepreneur Dr. Brian Watt

921
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:15,274
has been charged in a bizarre
string of poisonings...

922
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:17,109
Hi there.
Are my sweaters ready?

923
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:19,612
I didn't think so.

924
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:22,114
This is Detective Bell
from the NYPD.

925
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,283
I told him about
the world's worst dry cleaner's,

926
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:25,484
and he got curious.

927
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:26,819
BELL:
Do you know who bought

928
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:28,337
this place from
the Korean couple

929
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,506
who used to own it?
It's a shell company.

930
00:41:30,508 --> 00:41:32,124
I can't even pronounce it,

931
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:34,794
but my friends at the NYPD
know all about it.

932
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:36,429
They think it's
linked to smuggling,

933
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:38,514
human trafficking...
other fun stuff.

934
00:41:38,516 --> 00:41:40,933
So now I know why you're
so terrible at dry cleaning.

935
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:43,052
Because the only thing
your owners want you to clean

936
00:41:43,054 --> 00:41:44,770
is their money.

937
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:47,556
BELL: And given all the security
cameras you have in here,

938
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:50,109
I bet if we execute this search
warrant we brought with us,

939
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:52,194
we'd find plenty of it.
Is that true?

940
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:55,314
(speaking Polish)

941
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,619
All right, get up.
Put your hands behind your back.

942
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,788
♪ Everything

943
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,242
♪ Is crystal clear...

944
00:42:06,244 --> 00:42:07,376
I did it!

945
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:08,861
Close that door immediately!

946
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:11,029
What's up?

947
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,581
I was examining
the osmia avoseta

948
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,700
that Gerald Lydon gave me,
and it got loose.

949
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:17,803
Oh, so there's an almost-extinct
bee flying around in here?

950
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:19,805
Yes, and I would rather
it didn't get out.

951
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,423
Okay. Well, I
took care of it.

952
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:23,058
That dry cleaner
you sent me to,

953
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,977
you deduced what
they were up to.

954
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,563
Bell sent in somebody to search
it, and everybody's arrested.

955
00:42:27,565 --> 00:42:29,849
Thought I was gonna
have to send you back there

956
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:31,734
three times more times.
Well done.

957
00:42:31,736 --> 00:42:33,486
Why didn't you tell me
when I came to you yesterday?

958
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:35,187
I wanted you to...

959
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:37,106
learn to trust
your own instincts.

960
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:39,658
♪ When the world
stops making sense... ♪

961
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,329
Good detective knows that
every task, every interaction,

962
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:45,114
no matter how seemingly banal,

963
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:47,399
has the potential
to contain multitudes.

964
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:51,170
I live my life alert
to this possibility.

965
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:53,172
I expect my colleagues
to do the same.
