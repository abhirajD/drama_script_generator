1
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:28,668
Yes?

2
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,171
I'm supposed to deliver some
tables and chairs to a party--

3
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:33,523
it starts in about
an hour-- and my, uh,

4
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,109
van broke down
just down the street.

5
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:37,527
You want me to call triple-A?

6
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:39,196
Actually, no. I need
to call my boss,

7
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:40,614
but my cell is dead.

8
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:42,032
I was hoping I could come in,

9
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:43,516
maybe charge it
for a few minutes?

10
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:46,853
Please? Look, if I
mess up this delivery,

11
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:48,371
I'm in some
serious trouble.

12
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,740
How about you give me
your boss's number?

13
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:52,209
I'll call him for you.

14
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:53,910
I just started today, actually.

15
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,329
I-I don't know my boss's number
off the top of my head.

16
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:58,698
I need to plug in my phone
so I can get it.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,034
Tell me the name of the company,
I'll call the office.

18
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:02,502
It's after hours.
Nobody's gonna answer.

19
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:04,054
Would you please
just open the door?

20
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,388
I'm sorry, but I don't know you.

21
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,706
I can't just let you in.

22
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,374
Lady, come on!
I'm gonna lose my job.

23
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:11,728
Please, just leave
before I call the cops.

24
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,852
Yeah, Broome
Street and Ludlow.

25
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:53,436
You'll send another van?

26
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,856
Great, thanks.

27
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,107
Talk about a Good Samaritan.

28
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:59,643
Saved my ass.

29
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,868
<i>And as he fled, the man</i>
<i>dropped his walking stick,</i>

30
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,737
which the police later
mistook for a weapon.

31
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,440
But he did so in order
to pick up the mongoose.

32
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:16,776
Which was, of course,
responsible

33
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,962
for the claw marks
I found at the crime scene.

34
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:23,216
The mongoose, you see, was quite
key in identifying the man.

35
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:24,784
He was a magician.

36
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:26,636
The rodent, part of his act.

37
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:28,838
Now, once I realized
the man's true connection

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,242
to the colonel, it became
obvious to me, the latter hadn't

39
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:33,510
been murdered after all.

40
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:34,895
He'd merely succumbed

41
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:37,764
to a heart attack,
after the appearance of a man

42
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:41,151
he'd sentenced
to death so long ago.

43
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:43,904
Again,

44
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:47,324
my name is Sherlock,
and I am an addict.

45
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,279
That was a morning
of firsts.

46
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,748
First share I've ever heard
involving a mongoose.

47
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,482
Really?

48
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:59,336
It was also the first time you
ever contributed at a meeting.

49
00:02:59,338 --> 00:03:00,787
Why am I not
surprised

50
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,339
it had nothing to do
with your drug history?

51
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:04,541
Ah, you know, it seems
so expected, doesn't it?

52
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:06,960
Talking about addiction at an
addiction support group meeting.

53
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:09,012
Besides, the group seemed
particularly down today.

54
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,597
The last thing

55
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,665
they needed to hear
was another depressing share.

56
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,001
Is that why you decided to take
the floor? To cheer everyone up?

57
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:17,470
You know me, Watson.
People person.

58
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:27,230
Hello.

59
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,901
Uh... Sherlock?

60
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,820
Can you come up here, please?

61
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,373
Right now?

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,381
Rhys.

63
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,832
I, uh... I let
myself in.

64
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,500
I still had the
key from last time.

65
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:49,869
I tried calling, but
your number's changed.

66
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,471
Oh, so you know
each other.

67
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:53,089
That's almost
a relief.

68
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,058
Something's wrong.

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,893
Yeah. It's Emily.

70
00:03:56,895 --> 00:04:00,880
She's, uh...
she's been kidnapped.

71
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:02,482
When was she taken?

72
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:05,551
Well, a ransom demand
two days ago from her e-mail?

73
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:07,553
Video or note?
A video.

74
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,105
What are they
asking for?

75
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:10,490
Clearly this is
very important,

76
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:12,909
but do you think
that we could press pause

77
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,495
until we are all clothed?

78
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,783
Ah.

79
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,921
Love a cup of tea,
if you've got some.

80
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:26,673
Yeah.
Yeah. Right.

81
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,292
Um, sorry.
This is my room.

82
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:34,764
So, obviously,
he's an old friend.

83
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,066
Who's Emily?

84
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,801
His daughter.
She lives in New York.

85
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:40,303
And for clarity's sake,
Rhys isn't an old friend.

86
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,938
Well, not exactly.

87
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,807
He's, uh, my former drug dealer.

As you may have guessed,

00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,282
last time Rhys was here,
he stayed in your room.

93
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:14,517
This was when you
were still using.

94
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,319
Two months after
I got to New York,

95
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:18,688
before I was carted
off to rehab.

96
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,874
Let's talk about this.
What's to talk about?

97
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:23,043
The daughter
of an old friend is in trouble.

98
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:24,494
He's not just
an old friend.

99
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,829
He's the man
who used to supply me

100
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,530
with narcotics;
yes, I am well aware.

101
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,916
Doesn't make his daughter
any less kidnapped.

102
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,502
And it's worth noting,
he is an <i>ex-dealer,</i>

103
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:35,538
just as I am
an <i>ex-junkie.</i>

104
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,590
Two phoenixes risen
from the ashes.

105
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:39,259
This isn't about
what he is now.

106
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:41,377
It's about what he was
to you back then.

107
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,212
You think he may be some sort
of trigger?

108
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:46,649
On a giant gun filled with drugs
pointed at you, yes.

109
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:50,386
You're right.
He <i>is</i> a trigger.

110
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:52,572
The minute I laid eyes on him,

111
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:55,241
my mind conjured images
of heroin bubbling in a spoon.

112
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:56,559
I felt an undeniable,

113
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:58,395
almost gravitational pull.

114
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:01,397
Yet, as I've already mentioned,
I consider the man a friend.

115
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,199
I will not be
turning him away.

116
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,902
I appreciate your opinion
and your concern.

117
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:07,504
But you mistake
the support group ethos

118
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:08,922
for a complete system
for living.

119
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:11,574
It is not. At least not
to a man like me.

120
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:12,842
My sobriety

121
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:13,793
is on one plane.

122
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,095
The bonds I share with those

123
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:16,880
I consider friends
is on quite another.

124
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:19,182
You're just gonna have
to work a bit harder this week.

125
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:22,102
Not interrupting, am I?

126
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,087
Sorry again
about upstairs.

127
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,855
I was...
Haven't quite had

128
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:28,274
my head screwed on the last
couple of days, you know?

129
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,943
Should've figured
you'd have a bird over.

130
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:32,062
I'm not a bird. I live here.

131
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,531
I'm entirely
sober now, Rhys.

132
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,116
Miss Watson is
my companion.

133
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:37,600
She keeps me from
resuming bad habits.

134
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:40,036
Of which I am one.
I get it.

135
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,405
In which case,
let me show you this video.

136
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:45,041
If you can't help me,
I'll be on my way.

137
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,627
I'll just get my tea.

138
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:52,382
Your daughter's life boils down

139
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:56,953
to two numbers:
$2.2 million, four days.

140
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:59,288
If you don't pay in time,
she dies.

141
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,344
If you involve the police
or the FBI, she dies.

142
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:07,664
If you deviate
from my instructions in any way,

143
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,015
she dies.

144
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:10,483
I've left a phone for you

145
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,468
at her apartment;
keep it with you.

146
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,188
Wait for further instructions.

147
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:21,694
I went to her place
as soon as I touched down.

148
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,646
This is the cell phone.

149
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,949
Looked like there'd been
a bit of a struggle.

150
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,184
I was careful
not to touch it.

151
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,253
I'm sorry to interrupt,

152
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:34,207
but do you have
$2.2 million?

153
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,760
In May of 2011,
Rhys stole exactly that amount

154
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:39,429
from his Dominican suppliers.

155
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:40,880
He's been hiding out
in Thailand ever since.

156
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:42,832
Like I said, <i>ex-dealer.</i>

157
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,835
They got sloppy
with some transactions.

158
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:48,838
I saw an opportunity for
early retirement, and took it.

159
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,640
It never occurred to you
that you might be

160
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:51,724
putting your daughter in danger?

161
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:53,009
Well, no one knew about Emily.

162
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:55,612
But he knew 'cause
he deduced it.

163
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:57,447
But I never spoke about
her to anyone else, never.

164
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,199
Her mom knew, obviously, but...

165
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:00,783
She passed away
several years ago.

166
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:04,037
Did Emily know about your theft
from the Dominicans?

167
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,323
No. Before I disappeared, I gave
her an e-mail address, and said,

168
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:09,492
"Look, if you're ever in
trouble, you can get in touch,"

169
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:12,045
but I hadn't heard from her
till I got this video.

170
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:13,746
Well, isn't there
a simple solution?

171
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:16,299
You pay the ransom,
and you get your daughter back.

172
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,469
How much is left?

173
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:22,889
Uh... just under two.

174
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:24,591
$2 million
is nothing to sneeze at.

175
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:27,093
$2,000, you know, give or take.

176
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:31,547
You spent $2 million
in just 18 months?

177
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,899
No, I lost $2 million.

178
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,684
Drugs were his vice.

179
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:37,337
Cards were mine. Look, I'm
sorry. I'm even sorrier

180
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,389
now that I know that you're
trying to clean up. I just...

181
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:42,725
I don't mean to go stirring up
bad memories. I just didn't know

182
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,161
who else to turn to. Said
he'd kill Emily if I went

183
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:46,496
to the cops or the feds.

184
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,198
And I figured,
since I was acquainted

185
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,000
with <i>the</i> Sherlock Holmes,
I'd be a fool not to...

186
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,919
seek his advice, right

187
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:56,956
We have just under 44 hours
until the ransom is due.

188
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,043
Luxury.

189
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:01,844
That's twice what I'll need.

190
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:19,696
That's Emily's
mom... Penny.

191
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:21,147
You said she passed away.

192
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:22,982
Yeah, some kind of
cancer, I think.

193
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:25,735
Well, we were
never that close.

194
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:30,106
She was American on holiday
in London back in '91.

195
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:33,042
We met, had some fun...
then along came Emily.

196
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:38,164
How are you not
a total wreck right now?

197
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:42,468
If my kid was taken
and held for ransom,

198
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,638
I don't know
if I could keep it together.

199
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,958
You seem quite...
I don't know-- Zen.

200
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,761
Huh.

201
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:54,647
I made a delivery once to
Holmes at Scotland Yard.

202
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,399
Crazy, right?

203
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,634
Crazier still,

204
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,970
he invites me to stay
and watch him assist

205
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:02,855
in the interrogation
of this lunatic

206
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:04,657
who'd been planting car
bombs all over the city.

207
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:07,110
The police knew there was
another one out there,

208
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,828
but they didn't
know where it was.

209
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,114
Holmes is in the room with the
guy for, like, five minutes.

210
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,665
Figures out
where the bomb is

211
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,284
from a couple of stains
on the guy's shoe.

212
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:17,420
You ask why I'm
not a total wreck?

213
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:20,290
'Cause I believe
in Sherlock Holmes.

214
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,958
Your friends,
the Dominicans-- they were here.

215
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,127
Or at least
one of them was, anyway.

216
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,097
He waited for her here.

217
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,383
I found traces
of cigarette ash on the floor.

218
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:33,436
Now, how do I know
it didn't come from Emily? Easy.

219
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:36,672
She's not a smoker. No
other signs of tobacco

220
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:39,058
in the whole apartment. She
doesn't even have a lighter.

221
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,362
This ash comes from a Crema,
a popular Dominican brand.

222
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:44,180
You can tell the brand
by the ash?

223
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,531
I can identify 140 cigarette

224
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,317
and cigar brands
by their ash alone.

225
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,068
Now, if you bothered
to read my monographs,

226
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,486
you would know that.

227
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,238
So, they
struggled here.

228
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,123
She dropped her glass
of water that she poured.

229
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,359
The water spilled
on his hand.

230
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:58,244
How else do you explain this?

231
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:02,665
It's just a swirl.

232
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,300
It is a symbol,

233
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:06,886
that of the Taino god
of hurricanes.

234
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:09,705
The Taino, as everyone knows,
were the pre-Colombian

235
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:11,924
inhabitants of what is now
the Dominican Republic.

236
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,761
This, meanwhile, is a hand stamp

237
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:16,846
of a Dominican nightclub
in Brooklyn

238
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:20,233
called, appropriately enough,
Hurrikane, with a "K."

239
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:22,035
<i>Emily's water moistened</i>
<i>the hand stamp</i>

240
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:24,821
<i>on her abductor's hand,</i>
<i>facilitating its transfer</i>

241
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,389
to the wall.

242
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,541
Maybe he left some prints.

243
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:30,860
Already checked-- he wiped down
the doorknobs before he left.

244
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,862
How do you know the stamp
didn't come from Emily's hand?

245
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:35,698
Well, she'd just got back
from a jog, hence the water.

246
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,867
No nightclub would allow her in
wearing exercise gear,

247
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:40,420
let alone one as pretentious
as Hurrikane with a "K."

248
00:11:40,422 --> 00:11:42,338
Her kidnapper came
from a nightclub,

249
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,507
and that is where we shall go.

250
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:47,794
"I believe in Sherlock Holmes."

251
00:11:58,055 --> 00:11:59,889
This is seriously
the plan?

252
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:02,275
Rhys walks around
on the off chance

253
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:05,361
he recognizes someone
before they recognize him?

254
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:08,231
Well, he's wearing a hat.

255
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,904
Are there other, more surgical
ways to search this nightclub?

256
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,456
Yes, of course, but
they would require

257
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,492
the manpower and resources
of an NYPD or an FBI,

258
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:20,993
and both are
off-limits to us.

259
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:22,378
But if he spots someone

260
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,297
from his days dealing
with the cartel,

261
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,965
we'll follow them.

262
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:32,972
You seem even more dour
than usual, Watson.

263
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:35,308
I would posit it was
a menstruation issue,

264
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,094
but I worked out your cycle--
you're good for ten more days.

265
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,062
Couching it as
a scientific observation

266
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:41,964
totally negates the misogyny.

267
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,766
And for the record,
I'm not happy

268
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:46,402
because we are in a nightclub
surrounded by alcohol,

269
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:48,738
and-and, judging by the way
people are dancing,

270
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,306
serious drugs.

271
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:53,276
Told you it was gonna be
a difficult few days.

272
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:54,643
Okay,

273
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:56,446
over in the corner,
the VIP area,

274
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:58,865
see the big guy in there
with a beard?

275
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:01,417
Right?
His name's Reynaldo.

276
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,369
He's one of
the U.K. suppliers.

277
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,755
Is he the one you stole from?
Technically, I stole from them all,

278
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:07,823
but, yeah, he'd be
pretty upset with me.

279
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:09,292
So, obviously,
more than a coincidence--

280
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:11,494
a man you stole from
sitting in a nightclub

281
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:14,663
that Emily's abductor was in
just before she was taken.

282
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:17,350
So what do
we do now?

283
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:18,834
Now...

284
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:21,270
I urinate.

285
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,950
Nice tats.

286
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,620
My name is Sherlock Holmes--
I'm a consultant

287
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:39,572
with the NYPD. I'm looking for a
kidnapping victim.

288
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:41,958
Her name is Emily Grant.
I believe that your friend Reynaldo

289
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,008
may be responsible.

290
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,962
Would you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

291
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:48,080
No hablo inglés.

292
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,049
That's strange.

293
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,834
I'm fairly certain
that English...

294
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,003
is a requirement for agents

295
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,372
of the DEA-- even
those deep undercover

296
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:58,007
in Dominican
drug cartels. Hmm?

297
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,875
What gave you
away, you ask?

298
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:02,094
Well, first it was
your tradecraft.

299
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,013
<i>Out there, you used</i>
<i>the nearest champagne bucket</i>

300
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:05,714
<i>to monitor your surroundings</i>
<i>behind you without turning</i>

301
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,716
your head-- that's not
a technique one learns

302
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:10,052
on the street, but at Quantico.
Then there are

303
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:12,905
<i>your tattoos--</i>
<i>they're all perfectly thuggish,</i>

304
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:14,657
all precisely
the same age.

305
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,659
Most tattoos are
acquired over time.

306
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:17,944
Hmm? Each emblem

307
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:19,662
fades and ages
differently-- not yours.

308
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:22,081
Yours would seem to suggest
you were in a hurry

309
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,750
to fit in with a new crowd.

310
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:27,286
Please, I have no interest
in jeopardizing your operation,

311
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:29,205
but a woman's life is at stake,

312
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,958
and given that you are a federal agent...
Call me a fed again,

313
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,093
I'll cut out your tongue
and feed it to you.

314
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,761
Well, perhaps your friends
in the VIP area

315
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,930
will be more interested
in what I have to say.

316
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:40,850
My boys love hearing
about the DEA.

317
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,969
Like waving red
at a bull.

318
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,137
Olé!

319
00:14:57,618 --> 00:14:58,934
It's okay.

320
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,953
Guy tried to steal
my wallet, man!

321
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:03,990
Stay, please.
Just stay, stay, stay.

322
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:07,460
Stay out of it.

323
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:09,629
You didn't give me any choice--
I'm in too deep,

324
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:10,963
and I cannot let you
blow my cover.

325
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:12,781
I just need to know
where to find the girl.

326
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,118
Nobody in this organization
has kidnapped anyone

327
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,420
in New York, trust me.

328
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,839
Reynaldo over there, he <i>is</i>

329
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:23,292
the cartel in New York-- nothing
happens without his say-so.

330
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:25,127
The only thing he
cares about right now

331
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,929
is the turf war
with the Colombians.

332
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,931
I'm sorry, but you
may be looking into

333
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,517
the one crime in this city
the cartel isn't behind.

334
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,205
Suffocatingly inane.

335
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,274
Good morning.

336
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:54,994
This is soul-crushing
in its utter banality.

337
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,595
Sufficiently asinine
as to constitute

338
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,431
a valid argument
for eugenics.

339
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:00,933
Okay, I give up.

340
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,001
What are you reading?

341
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,003
Emily's Twitter feed.

342
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,273
Excruciating medium.

343
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:11,394
Demonstrates that brevity does
not protect against dullness.

344
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,312
That said, it does serve

345
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:15,514
as a modern-day equivalent
of a diary,

346
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,818
so who's to say
it won't turn up a suspect?

347
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,369
So you've given up
on the cartel.

348
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:22,020
For now, yes.

349
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,774
Though the ash and ink stain
I found does suggest to me

350
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,625
that Emily's abductor
<i>was</i> in that nightclub

351
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:28,210
before he took her.

352
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:31,080
Well, we have
an appointment at noon.

353
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,416
So plan your hunt
around that.

354
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:35,801
No. We visited the house
of bromides yesterday.

355
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,670
I am no longer required
to supplicate

356
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:39,588
at the altar of
recovery every day.

357
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,258
You are when your ex-drug dealer
is living with us.

358
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,094
So you wanted me to work harder;
this is working harder.

359
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:48,147
Fine. I suppose they
might find the case

360
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,232
of the blue carbuncle
entertaining.

361
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:52,435
No, you're not gonna talk
about some old case.

362
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,437
You're gonna share
something real about your...

363
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:58,607
Mm, he really got you, huh?

364
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:01,727
The man had a cover to protect;
I hold nothing against him.

365
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,163
I'm gonna put some
antiseptic on that.

366
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,073
Hey, I need to get in there.

367
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,159
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'll be right there.

368
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,961
Two shakes.

369
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:26,552
It's all yours.

370
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,105
You're kidding me,

371
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:30,189
right?

372
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,607
I'm a sober companion.

373
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:33,809
You're in the home
of a recovering addict.

374
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,112
I opened the window.
You don't do drugs here.

375
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:38,063
That's not drugs; it's just
a little bit of wacky backy.

376
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:39,532
I mean, my daughter's
been kidnapped,

377
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:42,284
and I am under a bit
of strain right now.

378
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,737
I'm gonna do you the favor of
believing you're just an idiot.

379
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:46,405
Okay. Thank you.

380
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:47,957
Hey, I'm not
finished yet.

381
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,075
As much as I want you to
get your daughter back,

382
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:51,410
I need you to
understand--

383
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:53,212
Sherlock is my
number one priority.

384
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:55,714
So you will not do
drugs in his house,

385
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:57,299
you will not talk
to him about this,

386
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:59,284
and you will not talk about
drugs in his presence.

387
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,303
If I feel that you've
compromised his sobriety

388
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,973
in any way, I will turn
you in to the police

389
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:06,008
as a drug dealer
and a thief.

390
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:08,460
Are we clear?

391
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,015
Now give me the drugs.

392
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:15,133
Watson! Rhys!

393
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,520
Come along if you're
coming along!

394
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:24,860
Is that it?

395
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:32,150
We'll have to go
to an evening meeting, Watson.

396
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,203
My time wading
in the cesspool of social media

397
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:35,421
was not a complete waste.

398
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:36,956
What did you find?

399
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,591
Emily made
a curious Twitter entry

400
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,292
under the hashtag:
"that awkward moment."

401
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:41,927
Apparently,
it is a category

402
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,380
for documenting uncomfortable
social experiences.

403
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:46,298
Emily's read:
"When the man who used

404
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,101
to give you your allowance
comes to you for a loan."

405
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,519
Well, I never gave her
an allowance.

406
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:52,354
She was talking
about her stepfather.

407
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:53,355
Now, I cracked

408
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:54,356
her banking password--

409
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,357
your full name, by the way--

410
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,508
and I accessed
her records.

411
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,509
Seems she wrote

412
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,527
a series of checks

413
00:18:58,529 --> 00:18:59,695
to a man called Derrick Hughes.

414
00:18:59,697 --> 00:19:01,447
That is her stepdad,
but he's big

415
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,982
in real estate--
man, he's loaded.

416
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,349
If he's rich, then
why would he have

417
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,831
to borrow money from
his stepdaughter?

418
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:08,687
What...

419
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,789
Well, according to my friend
in the D.A. squad,

420
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,524
<i>Derrick Hughes</i>
<i>had all kinds of money--</i>

421
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,359
emphasis on "had."

422
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,078
<i>Now, after the crash in '08,</i>

423
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
<i>banks foreclosed</i>
<i>on most of his properties.</i>

424
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:20,716
<i>Now, guy doesn't have</i>
<i>a criminal record, but...</i>

425
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:22,574
he is dead broke.

426
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:23,619
Thank you, Detective.

427
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,371
Please let me know when
I can return the favor.

428
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,890
How about you just tell me why
you're interested in the guy.

429
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:32,678
Course not.

430
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,981
So, Derrick Hughes
has motive to kidnap Emily.

431
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,766
He's desperate for money.

432
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,602
Reduced to working
as a parking attendant.

433
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:41,937
If she confided in him
about your thievery,

434
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,556
maybe he saw it as
a solution to his problems.

435
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,775
Never liked the guy.

436
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:49,227
I never met him,
but still.

437
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,496
So what are we supposed to do?

438
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:51,563
We supposed to just wait here

439
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,865
until he
gets off work?

440
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,284
Well, if he has her,
he will go to her.

441
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:57,503
Well, I'm gonna
order some food,

442
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:00,289
and maybe they'll
turn on the heat.

443
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,679
You're doing good, man.

444
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:09,098
It's nice to see you.
I'm proud of you.

445
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,116
Must be like...
trying to relearn

446
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:13,686
the piano after
a stroke, huh?

447
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:16,421
What must be like trying
to relearn the piano?

448
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,724
Well, doing what you
do without the...

449
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,859
the drugs.

450
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,412
Ridiculous. Detective work
is a deductive science.

451
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,781
Drugs are a hindrance
to that, not a help.

452
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,399
Yeah, but
there's, like,

453
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:29,068
two parts to what
you do, isn't there?

454
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,070
I mean, there's the
"knowing stuff" part--

455
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:33,289
and you've got that
covered-- and then there's

456
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,740
the making connections.

457
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:37,293
That's, like, the-the...
the creative part.

458
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:38,744
The art, right?

459
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:41,113
I suppose so.
Some artists,

460
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,466
they need the drugs
to fuel the creative stuff.

461
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,135
Are you suggesting
that I was

462
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:48,170
a better detective
when I was high?

463
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,139
No, no, not exactly.

464
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,808
It's just, well, there'd be
no shame in it, would there?

465
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,977
I mean, the Stones
never made a decent album

466
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,313
after they cleaned up,
and look at them.

467
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,682
Just, it must be hard,
that's all.

468
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:02,101
Is everything okay?

469
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,819
Yeah. Why
wouldn't it be?

470
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,322
Because Derrick Hughes
is getting off work

471
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:09,241
and you guys are
just sitting here.

472
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:21,486
Public records indicate

473
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,339
that this is one
of several buildings

474
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:25,323
that he bought in the area.

475
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,760
Apparently, he made
a rather large bet

476
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:30,212
that the area would gentrify.

477
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:31,380
Bad investment.

478
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:32,965
Well, not entirely.

479
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:35,184
He came out of it with
a perfectly good place

480
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:36,552
to hide a
kidnapped girl.

481
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:38,187
You think he's got
Emily in there?

482
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:39,521
I'd like to know why he

483
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:42,507
brought groceries to
an abandoned building.

484
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:50,232
Where'd he go?

485
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,651
What is this place?

486
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:56,538
I can explain.

487
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,457
It's just for a few days.

488
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,793
What's just for a few days?
Where is she?

489
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:01,860
Where's who?

490
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,662
Emily. Where are
you hiding her?

491
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:05,164
My daughter?

492
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,883
You people aren't with
the Housing Authority?

493
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:09,585
She's not
your daughter!

494
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:11,670
Mr. Hughes, my name
is Sherlock Holmes.

495
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:13,138
I'm a consultant
with the NYPD.

496
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,807
This is Joan Watson;
she's my associate.

497
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,759
This...
Yeah, I've seen his face in pictures.

498
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:18,343
You're Rhys.

499
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:20,596
That's right,
and I'm here to take Emily home.

500
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:21,980
Uh, Rhys...

501
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:24,066
the groceries
were not for her.

502
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:25,567
Mr. Hughes is
squatting here.

503
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,019
Technically,

504
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,654
I still own the place.

505
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:30,055
What happened to Emily?

506
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,907
She was kidnapped,
Mr. Hughes.

507
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:33,942
Oh, my God.

508
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:36,561
Emily...

509
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,231
What, you thought I did it?

510
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,083
Look around all you want.

511
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,401
Ask me any questions you want.

512
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,370
I raised her.
I would never hurt her.

513
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:46,438
You took money from her.

514
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,423
Yeah, I'm in a pinch.

515
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:48,573
She helped me out.

516
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,708
You haven't been
to a nightclub

517
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,126
called Hurrikane
by any chance

518
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:52,261
this week, have you?

519
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:53,578
Uh, no.

520
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,130
I've never even heard of it.

521
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:56,882
I say he's lying.

522
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:59,435
Do I look like a guy that's
been going to nightclubs much?

523
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:00,752
Sorry to have
troubled you, Mr. Hughes.

524
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,187
We'll be in touch.

525
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:07,926
You could have let me
rough him up a bit.

526
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,928
The man's body language
spoke volumes.

527
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,596
He fairly reeked
of innocence.

528
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:15,234
Hey, hey.

529
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,103
Hello.

530
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,105
Did you think
I wouldn't be watching?

531
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,373
Wait, what?

532
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,158
I told you
not to involve the police.

533
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,626
Who are you working with?

534
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,444
N-No, he, uh,
he isn't the police, he...

535
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,297
I assure you,
I am not the police.

536
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,883
I'm a friend,
an independent mediator.

537
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:32,668
You just cost yourself 12 hours.

538
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,804
I want the money by 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow, or she's dead.

539
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,006
And to ensure
we all understand each other,

540
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:39,174
I've left you something.

541
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:41,093
It's outside your kitchen door.

542
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:59,278
Oh, my God.

543
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:14,223
You sure it's Emily's?

544
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:16,991
I, uh, I compared
the fingerprint

545
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,676
with ones I lifted
from Emily's cell phone.

546
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:20,378
The finger is hers.

547
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,381
Well, was hers, anyway.

548
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:24,916
You have surveillance cameras
inside the house.

549
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:26,284
Do you have any outside?

550
00:24:26,286 --> 00:24:28,503
Only one. It covers
the garden level door,

551
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:30,321
and the kidnapper
never came squarely into view.

552
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:32,507
Good news is,
Emily's severed digit

553
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:35,193
may provide a clue
as to her location.

554
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:36,778
Please.

555
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:47,605
Looks like a burn.
It <i>is</i> a burn.

556
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,257
Quite a distinctive burn,
as a matter of fact.

557
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,243
It matches a floral design
found on a cast-iron radiator

558
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,711
forged at the turn
of the century.

559
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:56,581
Suggests she is
in a pre-war building.

560
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,132
<i>She's likely been chained</i>
<i>to the radiator,</i>

561
00:24:58,134 --> 00:24:59,250
hence the burn.

562
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:02,220
Now, look under
the fingernail.

563
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:06,758
Ethiopian <i>wat.</i>

564
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,676
Spiced onion-based stew.

565
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:10,979
You can tell that
just by looking at it?

566
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:12,480
No, I can tell it
by tasting it.

567
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:13,765
It's unlikely her abductor
is preparing

568
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,517
elaborate ethnic meals
for her himself,

569
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,069
so let's assume the <i>wat</i>
is of the takeout variety.

570
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:19,771
Now, if the restaurant

571
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,523
is in the vicinity
of the kidnapper's lair,

572
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:24,108
I can use historical
building permits to identify

573
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,910
pre-war structures.
I then cross-reference

574
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:27,061
those addresses
with those of every

575
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:28,413
Ethiopian place in the city.

576
00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:30,231
Provided the selection's
narrow enough,

577
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:33,284
I should be able to determine
which building is housing Emily.

578
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:35,837
What about you?

579
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,905
How are you doing?

580
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:39,591
If you're asking if
I'm on the verge of a relapse,

581
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:41,426
the answer is
a definitive "no."

582
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:44,963
Well, you just seem a
little, uh, intense.

583
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:46,598
Well, we are
on deadline, hmm?

584
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,266
Would you mind going downstairs
and checking on Rhys?

585
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:49,767
He went down there
37 minutes ago.

586
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,436
I've heard nary
a floorboard creak since.

587
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:55,106
A long time for someone of his
disposition to go motionless.

588
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,068
Habesha.

589
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,324
Brought you some tea.

590
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,378
How are you doing?

591
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:23,217
Well, I'd like to say
fine and dandy, but....

592
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:27,005
just saw a piece
of my little girl in a box.

593
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:30,758
How about you?

594
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,228
Um, Sherlock's just
examining the...

595
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,314
the package that
we received.

596
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:40,518
He thinks it might be able
to help him locate Emily.

597
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,523
He thinks it might
be able to help him.

598
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:48,276
That doesn't sound like
the Sherlock I used to know.

599
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:50,578
He just needs a little
more time, that's all.

600
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,331
I need some air.

601
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,584
Rhys, for what
it's worth...

602
00:26:58,504 --> 00:27:01,172
...I believe
in Sherlock Holmes, too,

603
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:10,331
If you involve
the police or the FBI, she dies.

604
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,350
If you deviate
from my instructions

605
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:14,669
in any way, she dies.

606
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:17,338
I've left a phone
for you at her apartment;

607
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,506
keep it with you.

608
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:20,208
Wait for further instructions.

609
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:25,196
Your daughter's life
boils down to two numbers:

610
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:28,616
$2.2 million, four days.

611
00:27:35,692 --> 00:27:37,358
How we doing?

612
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,694
I thought I was on to
something with the finger--

613
00:27:39,696 --> 00:27:41,045
the connection
between pre-war buildings

614
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:42,630
and Ethiopian restaurants--

615
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:45,216
but it turns out there are
too many of both of those

616
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:46,884
to be helpful,
so I'm revisiting

617
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:49,053
the ransom video.

618
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:50,338
See if there's a detail,

619
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,556
a clue to her whereabouts

620
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:52,974
that I might have missed
the first time.

621
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:55,643
Light, shadow,
noises in the background,

622
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:56,844
reflection in the cornea--

623
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,346
any tiny detail
could be the key.

624
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:01,432
Do you remember the...
Tinsdale case?

625
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:03,184
That security nut.

626
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:05,386
Had more alarms in his house
than he had doors.

627
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:07,722
Used to lock himself in
his bedroom every night.

628
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:09,574
Died in his sleep.
Suffocated.

629
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,275
You were sure it was murder,
but there was no evidence

630
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:12,326
anyone else had been inside.

631
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:15,463
Huh?

632
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:21,335
I remember, uh...
I remember I brought you

633
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:23,404
a little cocaine,
watched you shoot up.

634
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:26,874
Like, within a minute,
you had the whole thing sussed.

635
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:31,596
It was the maid; she'd left
some dry ice under his bed.

636
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:33,598
And then it evaporated,
turned to carbon dioxide.

637
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,916
He died in his sleep, no
one was any the wiser.

638
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:36,917
Except you,

639
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,436
of course.

640
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:40,972
Remember?

641
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:54,285
It's time, huh?

642
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:55,870
For Emily.

643
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:11,586
Why would you do that?

644
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:13,054
You've needed it
the last two days!

645
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:15,456
I assure you, I have not!

646
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,791
Have you listened
to yourself?

647
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:18,593
The rubbish you've
been spouting?

648
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:21,979
Huh? About lights and shadows
and reflections and corneas.

649
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:23,564
That's not you,
that's not Sherlock Holmes.

650
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:25,900
This is some ghost of
you, some pale imitation.

651
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,185
You need your meds.

652
00:29:27,187 --> 00:29:28,820
Get yourself right.

653
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:30,021
Please.

654
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:31,906
Please, man, I'm begging you.

655
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,658
For Emily.

656
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,743
- For Emily's life.
- What the hell is

657
00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:38,496
going on down here?!

658
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:40,915
I-I need
some time, Watson.

659
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,667
I will be in touch.

660
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:48,589
Why is he so upset?

661
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:50,091
What-what did you say to him?

662
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,511
The truth.

663
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:56,130
It's the God's
honest truth.

664
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:20,822
This is Sherlock Holmes.

665
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:23,875
I would like to speak
with my father.

666
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,802
Good news, Rhys.

667
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:37,338
You will be reunited
with Emily within the hour.

668
00:30:38,157 --> 00:30:39,423
What, you found her?

669
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:40,758
I telephoned the kidnapper.

670
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,226
I told him we would
pay the ransom.

671
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,728
But you know I don't
have the money.

672
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,646
I have the money,
or at least, my father does.

673
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:47,231
I reached out to him.

674
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:49,767
He agreed to loan me

675
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,569
$2.2 million, on condition

676
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:54,222
that I perform various errands
for him in the near future.

677
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:55,907
Don't know what
they are yet, but, uh,

678
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:58,192
knowing him, it's a virtual lock
I will be stealing candy

679
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:00,077
from infants
or clubbing young seals.

680
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,729
I can't believe you reached out
to your father.

681
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:03,030
Oh, man, I
don't know what

682
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:04,365
to say, man
We're going to meet

683
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,784
Emily's abductor
at 238th and Irwin

684
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:08,619
in, uh, just under an hour.

685
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:09,871
He will be in a blue van.

686
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:11,572
I transfer the money
electronically,

687
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:12,740
he will release her.

688
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:14,425
Watson, would you
be so kind

689
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:15,843
as to fetch my tablet for me?

690
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:17,011
I'll need it to
perform the transfer.

691
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:18,546
Sure.

692
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:20,932
Thank you.

693
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:22,884
There's something that
you need to understand.

694
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:24,936
Given a little more time,
I would have found Emily

695
00:31:24,938 --> 00:31:27,438
by my own devices;
of this I have no doubt.

696
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
But it occurred to me that
a little more time with you

697
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:31,058
is a dangerous thing.

698
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,727
The fact that the
money I've procured

699
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:34,612
will liberate Emily
is almost incidental.

700
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:37,431
What it's really doing, Rhys,
is buying a life without you.

701
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,234
After today, you are never
to darken my doorway again.

702
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:41,652
Our friendship has
run its course.

703
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,621
Have I made myself clear?

704
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:51,295
♪

705
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,351
Can I help you?

706
00:32:13,353 --> 00:32:14,852
Yeah, Special Agent Xande Diaz.

707
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:16,020
I'm looking for Sherlock Holmes.

708
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:17,972
I've uncovered
some information

709
00:32:17,974 --> 00:32:20,524
about the girl
he's trying to find.

710
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,743
He needs to know
about it right away.

711
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:52,339
Hello.
It was an ambush.

712
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:54,442
A group of painters
when I arrived on the scene.

713
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:58,145
But they're not painters--
their shoes

714
00:32:58,147 --> 00:33:00,531
<i>were as clean</i>
<i>as they are expensive.</i>

715
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:04,068
They're a hit squad--

716
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,454
employees, no doubt,
of the Dominican cartel

717
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:08,539
that we crossed paths
with the other night.

718
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:11,459
One of them used
the word <i>"aguajero."</i>

719
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:15,379
It's Dominican slang
for "braggart."

720
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:16,914
Someone told them
to lie in wait.

721
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,749
Someone who had pull
within the organization.

722
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:20,885
Someone who also knew I was
investigating Emily's abduction.

723
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:22,536
Only one person meets

724
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:25,139
those particular criteria...
The agent from the D.E.A.

725
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:27,758
The one who beat you up
the other night.

726
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,510
I know.

727
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:44,256
<i>Aq, aquíuí</i>

728
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:48,209
Your friends are alive,
Mr. Holmes.

729
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:49,210
Excellent.

730
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:50,645
How long depends on you.

731
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:52,163
Give me a moment
to secure transportation.

732
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,182
I'll meet you at my place.

733
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:55,933
We can talk face-to-face.

734
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:57,985
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

735
00:33:57,987 --> 00:34:00,438
Speaking of friends,
I just met some of yours.

736
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,240
I don't think
they liked me very much.

737
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:04,776
I told them you work
for a rival gang.

738
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,577
But now I realize
that sending them

739
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:07,845
after you was a mistake.

740
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:09,030
Oh?

741
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:10,331
The money
that you were offering,

742
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,083
I thought that was coming
from Rhys.

743
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,102
<i>I thought you would be</i>
<i>transferring it</i>

744
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:15,703
<i>from his account, not yours.</i>

745
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,071
<i>Now I know</i>

746
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:18,256
that wasn't the case.

747
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,542
So I must've, uh, scared you
the other night.

748
00:34:21,544 --> 00:34:24,429
Everything I was able
to deduce about you.

749
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:27,081
You thought you'd kill me,
then swoop

750
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,750
on the softer target, Rhys.

751
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:31,352
Get him to transfer the funds.

752
00:34:31,354 --> 00:34:33,087
You're pretty fit, Watson.
You know that?

753
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,356
But more importantly,

754
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:37,058
you're a good friend.

755
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,476
Could you just shut up?

756
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,228
I need you to do
something for me.

757
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,979
Tell Holmes I'm sorry.

758
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:43,781
Just stay calm.
You can tell him yourself.

759
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:45,933
Uh, not after I've cut
myself loose, I can't.

760
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:47,235
What are you doing?

761
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:48,319
Back in the day,

762
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,704
I dealt to a
famous punker

763
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,406
for a brief stretch
in the '80s.

764
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:54,876
One of them gave me a little
pocketknife as a keepsake.

765
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:57,128
Since then, the only thing
I've ever cut with it

766
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,279
has been lines of...

767
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,831
I get it. I get it. Just...

768
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,132
Y-You need to stop now.

769
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:03,918
No. I need to right
a terrible wrong.

770
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,838
Maybe a few terrible wrongs.

771
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,757
I'm gonna save you, and then
Holmes is gonna save Emily,

772
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:12,059
and then that'll
be that.

773
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:15,596
All I ask is you get
out that door, okay?

774
00:35:15,598 --> 00:35:17,565
I imagine that
you learned about the robbery

775
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,435
he'd perpetrated after
you infiltrated the cartel.

776
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:22,653
You know, they were never
able to find him

777
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,238
or the money.

778
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,191
But then again, they didn't
have the resources

779
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:29,694
of a powerful government agency
behind them,

780
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:31,696
did they? I imagine
you found his name

781
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:33,781
from Emily's Social Security
information?

782
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:34,982
Am I close?

783
00:35:34,984 --> 00:35:36,334
Listen to me.

784
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:38,413
I want you to transfer
the money now.

785
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:41,096
As soon as I see
it in my account,

786
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,533
I will let your
friends go.

787
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:45,365
You just tried
to have me killed, so...

788
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:47,901
give me a reason
I should trust you.

789
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:57,505
Watson! Watson!

790
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,478
Sherlock, Rhys has been shot.

791
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,813
Guy who did it is unconscious.
Call 911!

792
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,535
I had nothing to do with

793
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:12,820
this woman's abduction. Until
just now, I didn't even know

794
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,455
what she looked like.
That's funny.

795
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:16,991
Because according to a statement
we got from Joan Watson,

796
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:20,328
you approached her and
the girl's father this morning

797
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,079
with information
about her whereabouts.

798
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,881
Totally untrue.

799
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:26,167
What <i>is</i> true?

800
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,787
That I've been working
in the New York

801
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:32,874
faction of a Dominican drug
cartel for almost a year now.

802
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:35,876
That, during my time with them,
I became aware of a man

803
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:38,846
by the name of Rhys Kinlan,
a former employee of the cartel.

804
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:41,715
This would be the same Rhys
Kinlan you shot this morning?

805
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:44,202
In self-defense, yes.

806
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,153
Look,

807
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:47,989
I saw Mr. Kinlan
on the street today.

808
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:50,608
I followed him to a brownstone
where he appeared to be staying.

809
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,578
I thought he might be useful
to my investigation.

810
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,581
But when I told him
I was D.E.A., he panicked.

811
00:36:56,583 --> 00:37:00,585
He attacked me. I-I had
no choice but to restrain him.

812
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:03,237
Mm. And Miss Watson?

813
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,841
I regret that, but under
the circumstances, I....

814
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:09,743
assumed that she was working
with Mr. Kinlan.

815
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:11,012
He managed
to free himself.

816
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:12,763
He came at me with a knife,

817
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,265
so I fired on him.

818
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,917
You know, um, I heard
from a mutual acquaintance

819
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,886
of ours a little while ago.

820
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,304
Sherlock Holmes.

821
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:24,692
I believe you two talked
on the phone today.

822
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:27,812
He wishes he could be here, but
he actually went to the hospital

823
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:29,597
to see if Mr. Kinlan
pulls through.

824
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,567
And just-just out of curiosity,
if Kinlan does pull through,

825
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:36,404
whose version of events do you
think he's gonna agree with?

826
00:37:36,406 --> 00:37:39,290
Yours? Or Miss Watson's?

827
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:41,659
I don't think I care very much

828
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:43,744
what a known drug dealer
has to say.

829
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:45,546
Hard to imagine
a jury will either.

830
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:48,883
This is...
from the District Attorney.

831
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:51,252
Tell us

832
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:55,289
where the girl is and he'll
guarantee you protective custody

833
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,891
while you're in prison.

834
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:58,959
You do not

835
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:01,228
want to find yourself
in gen pop, Agent Diaz.

836
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,814
Especially not after
your cartel friends

837
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:06,133
realize you've been
spying on them.

838
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:07,401
Look, I'm sorry.

839
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:09,437
I wish I could help.

840
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:13,524
Actually, I think
you're hoping Emily dies.

841
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:16,277
'Cause then there's no one
to testify.

842
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:18,913
You might actually get away
with everything.

843
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:21,032
Did you know that
the apartment

844
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:23,034
you're doing the
undercover stint in

845
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:27,004
is about half a block away
from an Ethiopian restaurant?

846
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:29,790
I get takeout
from there sometimes. So what?

847
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:32,710
Did you also know that there are
exactly five pre-war buildings

848
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:35,996
in a one-mile radius of that
restaurant and your apartment?

849
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:38,599
Three of those buildings
are abandoned.

850
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:41,602
It's ideal for stashing
a kidnapped girl.

851
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:44,438
Holmes shared
a theory with me.

852
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,109
He thinks Emily's being kept
in a pre-war building

853
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:51,512
in close proximity
to an Ethiopian restaurant.

854
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:55,700
Right now, I've got
a small army of cops

855
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:57,985
searching the
aforementioned buildings.

856
00:38:57,987 --> 00:39:00,204
Now, personally, I think
it's just a matter of time

857
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:02,156
before they find her.

858
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:05,660
But considering that she needs
medical attention,

859
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:09,697
I would prefer it be sooner
rather than later.

860
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:14,135
Now, if you'd like
to reconsider

861
00:39:14,137 --> 00:39:17,338
the D.A.'s generous offer,

862
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,091
you know where we'll be.

863
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:22,093
Wait.

864
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,896
Wait.

865
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:38,659
You'd think after everything
I've done to my liver,

866
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:43,247
it could deflect a
couple of bullets, huh?

867
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:44,749
Emily. Is she...

868
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:45,916
Safe.

869
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,901
Recovered a short while ago.

870
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:54,458
Where's your... better half?

871
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,260
As you can imagine,
Miss Watson was quite spent

872
00:39:56,262 --> 00:39:57,745
after this morning's ordeal.

873
00:39:57,747 --> 00:39:59,096
She's getting some rest.

874
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:01,098
She saved my life, you know.

875
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,685
As I understand it, she was
just returning the favor.

876
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:07,555
What's this?

877
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:09,106
Money.

878
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:11,142
Not my father's money.

879
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:14,061
I returned that a few hours ago.

880
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:18,232
It's just... some cash I keep
lying around the brownstone

881
00:40:18,234 --> 00:40:20,201
to pay informants.
It's not much, but, um,

882
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:22,203
I assume you'll want
to go on the lam again

883
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:24,538
once you've recovered.

884
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,625
Is that for my benefit
or for yours?

885
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:31,495
The road to recovery,
I've found,

886
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:34,715
is as treacherous
as it is tedious.

887
00:40:34,717 --> 00:40:38,886
Tests of my sobriety
arise almost daily.

888
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:42,306
You were just the most recent.

889
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:47,461
Hey.

890
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:51,932
I believe in you.

891
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:54,134
Always will.

892
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:59,940
Dad.

893
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:02,610
Emily.

894
00:41:16,258 --> 00:41:19,376
And here I thought ol'
Angus had finally met his maker.

895
00:41:19,378 --> 00:41:21,545
You remembered his name.

896
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,497
Consider us touched.

897
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:26,467
How long have I
been asleep for?

898
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:28,001
Just over six hours.

899
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:34,708
You did a remarkable thing
today, Watson.

900
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,011
I just stopped the bleeding
till the paramedics got there.

901
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:40,815
After you incapacitated
an armed gunman.

902
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:43,016
Angus helped.

903
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,823
He offered me cocaine
last night.

904
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:50,908
Rhys.

905
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,911
He thought I needed it
to find his daughter.

906
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,130
It was right there
on the table.

907
00:41:56,132 --> 00:41:59,834
That's why I threw him
into the chair.

908
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:05,322
But you didn't use it.

909
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:07,992
Want to talk about it?

910
00:42:07,994 --> 00:42:10,010
Not with you.

911
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:13,380
That is to say,
I think it's a tale

912
00:42:13,382 --> 00:42:17,217
more suited to a...
group setting.

913
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,655
Others may find inspiration
in my abstinence.

914
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:24,358
Apparently.

915
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,862
Um, there's a meeting
in Cobble Hill in about...

916
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:30,114
15 minutes. Yeah.
So, I was thinking, um,

917
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:33,534
if you can hold off
on dinner for a bit then,

918
00:42:33,536 --> 00:42:35,419
you might join me?

919
